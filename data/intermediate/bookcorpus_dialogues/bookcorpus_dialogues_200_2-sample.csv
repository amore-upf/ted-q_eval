590124__come-as-you-are,Has he called you?,"No, Mom, I haven’t heard from him since the party. He told me ‘happy birthday’ and went back to brooding in the corner like he always does."
590124__come-as-you-are,He lied to us.,Mom.
590124__come-as-you-are,Is this news?,"Well, no, but we got into a fight the day before he left. It was a big argument that I think everyone is ashamed about. We all overreacted."
590124__come-as-you-are,"Did you hear me, Connor? Did you hear me?","Yes, I heard you.","He’s been living in Aberdeen, Washington. He got drunk and fell off a bridge."
590124__come-as-you-are,"Yes, of course I’ll go with you.","Oh, thank you so much, sweetie, I want to leave before eight, so get a move on."
590124__come-as-you-are,Did you pack a bag?,"Yeah, Mom. It’s in the backseat of Rusty."
590124__come-as-you-are,Your father gave me the keys to the new hearse. He said we could take it and that he would use the old one for business until we get back.,Seriously?
590124__come-as-you-are,Should I drive?,Is Dad going to see us off or anything?
590124__come-as-you-are,He’s downstairs with a client… but he asked me to send you in before we took off.,It’s the least you can do.
590124__come-as-you-are,Dad?,Down here.
590124__come-as-you-are,Do you remember Mr. Baxter from the ice cream shop down the street? He died two days ago from a heart attack. He was closing down the shop when all of a sudden…,"So, Mom and I are going to be heading up north pretty soon. She said you wanted to talk to me. Did you just want to talk to me about Mr. Baxter?"
590124__come-as-you-are,"No, no… We need to talk about August.",What’s there to say?
590124__come-as-you-are,I just feel really bad about what happened between us. I was never expecting it to go this way. I was never expecting him to run off and try to abandon all of us. I’m just so ashamed.,"Dad, being honest, I think August did what anyone in his position would have done. Something went wrong, really wrong, and he took off. He was scared and didn’t know what to do.",But look where it got him.,He didn’t know that running off to Aberdeen was going to lead up to him falling off a bridge. We just have to accept it at face value and move on. We have to learn from all the mistakes.
590124__come-as-you-are,I’ll have some paperwork to fill out before they’ll let us take August home. Will you come in with me and wait?,Of course.
590124__come-as-you-are,read and sign,"Well, hi."
590124__come-as-you-are,Is she mad?,"You know, being honest, I haven’t seen her angry the entire time you’ve been gone. I think she’s been worried and a little embarrassed about what happened between you guys, but I wouldn’t say she’s mad."
590124__come-as-you-are,"Thanks, I guess.","For someone who fell off a bridge, I mean.","I just got a few bumps and bruises, maybe a concussion. I hit my head pretty hard. But, I know who the President is, and I know my name and my birthday, and how many fingers, so I’m pretty sure I haven’t suffered any horrible brain damage or anything like that.",It could have been a lot worse.,"Yeah, I guess so."
590124__come-as-you-are,"So, you said you remember everything, no memory loss. Why didn’t you just tell the police who your parents were and how to get in contact with them?","I ran away, remember? I didn’t want to be found.",Why Aberdeen?,Is this Twenty Questions?,You ran away and have been missing for two months; what do you expect?,A parade.,"No. People who are kidnapped get parades, and kids who run away get grounded for a year. You should have faked your own abduction if you wanted a parade waiting for you in Anderson.",I wasn’t planning on going back there. Ever.
590124__come-as-you-are,Are we that bad? We’re that bad.,"It’s not you. I left because of the fight I had with Mom and Dad. I knew they weren’t the most accepting or understanding people in the world, but it was Three Mile Island in our house that night. You have no idea how bad it was."
590124__come-as-you-are,"So, fleeing across state lines seemed like your best option?","If they would have had it their way, everything would have just gone back to normal after that fight. They would have wanted to pretend nothing had happened at all. To me, the worst crime is faking it, and I just couldn’t do that anymore. Besides, you ran away.","No, I moved out. I packed my bags and moved into a tiny apartment across town. You, however, threw some crap into a backpack and fled the state. How did you do it, by the way?"
590124__come-as-you-are,I hitchhiked.,That’s one detail I’d leave out of my story to Mom and Dad.
590124__come-as-you-are,"So, what did you do while you were here?",I was happy.
590124__come-as-you-are,Come as you are!,"We need two rooms for the night, please."
590124__come-as-you-are,"I know she hasn’t really spoken to you yet, but I think you’re just going to have to give her some time and space.",I’m not too worried about that.,"I have a feeling you are, but I just don’t want you to think too much of it. She’s been an emotional wreck the whole day. She’s been through a lot—we all have, but especially her. She barely even said a word to me the whole drive here.",You should fix things with her.,You should fix things with her.
590124__come-as-you-are,Was it all worth it?,Do you want the truth or what I’m supposed to tell you?,The truth.,"I told you I was happy here, and I was. But there was always some little part of me that was worried about everyone back home. I knew Mom and Dad didn’t want me around, but I still worried some, you know?"
590124__come-as-you-are,"You didn’t hear some of the things they said. I remember the fight the three of you had when you moved out, and this was exponentially worse. It was atomic. It put Hiroshima and Nagasaki to shame.",Do you want to talk about the fight?
590124__come-as-you-are,What are you looking at?,It’s Mom. She’s walking towards the hearse.
590124__come-as-you-are,You’re a vegetarian? Since when?,"Well, since I became old enough to discover that it’s disgusting to raise animals simply for the purpose of slaughtering and eating them, especially when they’re raised in conditions that make said slaughter and eating a relief from the torturous lives they once lived."
590124__come-as-you-are,Do you eat fish?,"It’s okay to eat fish, because they don’t have any feelings."
590124__come-as-you-are,Do I look like that much of a tourist or outsider or whatever?,I don’t think so. What did she do? I didn’t really notice.,"She just looked at me like I’m a lunatic or something. I thought it might be the way I’m dressed. Maybe I don’t look like I belong in the wonderful little town of Aberdeen, Washington.","Well, you’re not wearing flannel. That could be the problem.","Neither are you, and she didn’t even give you a second glance. I, however, got the complete third degree."
590124__come-as-you-are,So what’s going on between you and Mom?,Nothing; we just got into a fight and I took off.,You’re trying to tell me it was just a fight? There was no real reason behind it? The three of you just decided it was a good time to start screaming at each other?,Is that so hard to believe?,You said yourself that it was like Three Mile Island. Those kinds of meltdowns don’t just happen for no apparent reason. I’m guessing you did something or told them something they didn’t want to hear.
590124__come-as-you-are,Fine. You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to.,You’re reverse psychology really isn’t going to work on me. It didn’t work when we were kids; it won’t work now.,"I know, but I’m your older brother; it’s my job to be kind of mean to you sometimes.","Isn’t it sad, though?",Isn’t what sad?
590124__come-as-you-are,"Yeah, it’s really pathetic. But, maybe this is where things change for us.","Yeah, maybe.",Is everything alright?
590124__come-as-you-are,"Everything’s fine, why?","No reason, darlin’. Are you ready for your check?"
590124__come-as-you-are,Where are you going? Motel’s that way.,"Would you believe me if I told you I know a shortcut? So, there’s this party tonight…","August, no!",But it’s perfect! It’s my last night in Aberdeen! I’ll never be in this town again!,"No, we can’t.",But it’ll be like a going away party! And I want you to come with me! You can meet the friends I made while I was here!,Mom will freak out if we don’t come back to the motel tonight.,She’ll never know.
590124__come-as-you-are,What’s in the bag? Is it alcohol?,No! It’s not alcohol. I swear. I learned my lesson about drinking a couple of days ago.,Then what’s inside?,You’ll see soon enough.
590124__come-as-you-are,"August, I need some answers! Where is this party? What am I getting myself into?",There is no party.
590124__come-as-you-are,What are you doing down here?,Don’t get mad.,"What’s going on August? You’re acting all weird and cryptic. I don’t like it. First you say we’re going to a party, and then there is no party. Now we end up under the bridge you fell off of. This is strange and I’m not a fan. Just tell me what’s going on.",Sorry.,It’s alright. What are you doing down here?,I’m leaving my mark on Aberdeen before I’m gone forever.
590124__come-as-you-are,You’re serious?,"Oh yeah, serious as a heart attack. Or as serious as falling off a bridge, I guess… I was just getting ready to start, if you wanted to help out.",What were you planning on leaving as your mark down here anyway?
590124__come-as-you-are,Come as you are.,Come as you are? As in the Nirvana song?,"Not only as in the song, but as in the slogan of this entire town. I’ve kind of picked it up as my own catchphrase as well. It’s fitting, I think. I mean, who doesn’t it apply to, really? Who can really say that they ‘come as they are’ in this world?",How very poetic of you.
590124__come-as-you-are,Well?,Mom’s trying to find us. I think she figured out we never made it back from dinner. We should probably get back to the motel before she has a coronary.
590124__come-as-you-are,I can’t believe we’re doing this right now.,Vandalism.
590124__come-as-you-are,"Two conditions. Rule one is that we do not mention this to Mom, like ever. She would kill us both in a second.",And?,"Rule two is that when we get back, you actually talk to her.","Rule one, yes. Rule two, maybe."
590124__come-as-you-are,Wait!,"Are you going to talk to her? The two of you haven’t spoken since we picked you up today. I understand that this is a tough situation, but you have to be willing to compromise. I love you, but you are a selfish little punk sometimes, and you killed her when you ran off. You killed all of us.","I don’t care if I have to tie both of you down and make you talk to each other, you will have an honest conversation with her when we get back to the motel. You’re not waiting until the drive home in the morning. You’re not waiting until we get back to California. You’re doing it tonight. Something’s gotta change here, and it starts with you."
590124__come-as-you-are,You’re a hypocrite.,Excuse me?,"You’ve barely talked to Mom the whole time we’ve been here, and the two of you didn’t even get into a fight! You took off and you left me to deal with everything for the past five years! How is that not worse than me avoiding my situation?"
590124__come-as-you-are,It’s not like that.,It’s just like that! You abandoned me!
590124__come-as-you-are,Stay where you are! Don’t move!,Shit.
590124__come-as-you-are,"Officers, I can explain. This is all a big misunderstanding.","Let me guess. You wanted to show how loyal of a fan you were to Kurt Cobain, so you came all the way out to his old stomping ground in order to leave your own mark on ‘his’  bridge? You’re not from around here, are you kid?",Please tell me you didn’t think that was an original idea.,"I know that’s what it looked like. But, I swear there’s more to the story than that."
590124__come-as-you-are,What about my brother?,Who? What are you talking about?
590124__come-as-you-are,"Hello, Doreen.","Good evening, Officer Troy."
590124__come-as-you-are,"I did it for my brother. He’s always been a Kurt Cobain fan, and I thought it would be a fitting tribute to my little brother’s philosophy of life.",What’s your name?,Connor Sennett.,Excuse me a moment. Wait here for me.
590124__come-as-you-are,"You’re brother, August Sennett’s his name?",yes.,"Who did you come to Aberdeen with, Mr. Sennett?",My mother.,"I know, I know. Look, I’m going to get a phone for you, and I want you to call your mom to come pick you up. I’m sure she’s worried about you, and I know you’ll need to be heading back to California first thing in the morning."
590124__come-as-you-are,What’s this all about?,"Look, vandalism is a problem in this town, but the two of us figure that you’ve been through enough and that you’re probably eager to get home. We can make an exception just this one time, considering the circumstances."
590124__come-as-you-are,Mom… I’m sorry.,Is he free to go?,Mrs. Sennett!,Ma’am. I just wanted to tell you personally how sorry I am for your loss.
590124__come-as-you-are,Tell me why.,"Mom, I’ll explain everything to you later, but right now we have to find August."
590124__come-as-you-are,What?,"August; he was with me under the bridge, but he took off when the police showed up. We really need to find him! What if he tries to run away again?",Why are you doing this to me?,"Please, listen to me. I thought I could talk to him and convince him to try to fix things with you. Neither of you have spoken to each other since we got here, and that’s not okay! The two of you need to talk this out, whatever caused the fight between you!"
590124__come-as-you-are,Why is that there?,Honey…
590124__come-as-you-are,Who are you? How do you know that name?,I’m Connor. August is—was my brother’s name.
590124__come-as-you-are,You’re Ezra.,You know me?
590124__come-as-you-are,No. But I’ve heard of you.,I was with August when he died.
590124__come-as-you-are,I know.,I tried to save him that night.,I know.,"It’s my fault he died! I jumped in after him, but he hit his head and was under water for too long. When I pulled him to the shore, he wasn’t breathing. We’d been drinking, and I told him not to get too close to the railing, but he didn’t listen to me."
590124__come-as-you-are,Don’t come any closer!,"Ezra, it’s not your fault. You tried to save him.","We were going to start a band, you know. We were going to make enough money to get an apartment and one day a record label would sign us, and we’d be famous. We’d be able to tell the story about how we’d started off on the streets of this shit-hole city, but persevered and made it to fame.",That sounds really cool. Maybe you’ll still be in a band one day.,I’d rather be dead than cool.
590124__come-as-you-are,"Ezra, step down off the railing. We can talk about it. I want to hear about your time with August while he was here.",There’s only one way off this railing for me. I should have saved him.
590124__come-as-you-are,What are you doing here?,You don’t get to ask that question. You came to see me this time.,Did I…,"Well, you’re talking to me, aren’t you? So I guess you did, yeah.",Shit. Did I at least save him?,"He’s going to be okay. But to be honest, it was more Officer Hodge who saved him than you. You croaked in the middle of CPR."
590124__come-as-you-are,"You’re not dead, Connor. Stop being so dramatic.","But you said—“ I started. “How am I here, talking to you, if I’m still alive?","How were you talking to me all day yesterday? You were alive then, and I was still as dead as ever."
590124__come-as-you-are,"So, I’m guessing I’m going to wake up in a hospital bed pretty soon, surrounded by friends and family, telling them about how I saw the light and talked to you about the meaning of life and death.",So. Dramatic.
590124__come-as-you-are,"Look, it’s weird. I know it’s weird. But just rest assured that you’re going to be alright, and Ezra is going to be alright, and Mom is going to be alright. Hell, I’m even going to be alright.","Yeah, I guess if you just hang out on a bridge all day, you’ll probably be alright.","Connor, this is your imagination, not mine. I’m probably floating around in Heaven with Lincoln and Gandhi, smoking cigars, and laughing about how seriously all you people down here take life.","Are you really in Heaven? I mean, is it real?",You’re really going to ask me that?,What’s going on?,"You’re waking up. You know that when you wake up, I won’t be there."
590124__come-as-you-are,You promise I’ll be okay?,You all will. But I need you to do something for me.
590124__come-as-you-are,Anything.,"You have to talk to Mom. She and I, we never got the resolution we needed. But you still have a chance to change things. Do you remember what you said to me under the bridge, when we were spray painting it?",The change has to start with you.
590124__come-as-you-are,What about Ezra?,"If you see him again, tell him that he changed my life. And tell him that he has to go on with his own. The hardest thing in this world is to live in it. Tell him to be brave, and to live.",Any parting words?,Only he who has seen better days and lives to see better days again knows their full value.,Is that another Kurt Cobain quote? Don’t think I haven’t noticed you throwing them out there over the past day.,"No, it’s Mark Twain. I can read, too, you know."
590124__come-as-you-are,"You saved my life, you know. But the problem with that is that I wanted to die.","Look, I…","No, I know. I get why you did it. I would have jumped in after someone, too. But what I don’t understand is how it all went down.",What do you mean?,You weren’t just some random person walking down the street who saw me jump. You’re August’s brother. We’re connected through him. How did you know I was going to be there? How did you know to come?,I don’t know.,"I thought you were him at first. I know that’s stupid, but I thought you were him and I wanted so badly for you to be him. The two of you look a lot alike.","It’s not stupid. At least not as stupid as me spending the entire day with him yesterday, even though he’s dead."
590124__come-as-you-are,You really didn’t know he was dead?,"I don’t know. I feel like I would have had to have known… How did I make it through the entire trip up here and the entire day, not knowing he was gone?","Our minds do crazy things to us when we don’t want to believe something. For instance, I thought jumping off that bridge would make everything alright. I thought it would somehow reunite us in the afterlife or… something.",He asked me to tell you something.,He did?,—Is to live in it.
590124__come-as-you-are,"He told me that once, when we first met. There’s no way you could have known that.","He wants you to be brave, and to live."
590124__come-as-you-are,I can take him from here.,Where’s the hearse?,"While you were recovering, I drove August home to your father so he could get preparations ready for the funeral. I decided it would be easier to drive Rusty back up here to get you.",Thank you.,"I wanted to stay with you the whole time, but with your brother’s body in the hearse, I…","Mom, thank you."

We saw it all with our own eyes. He brought us out of Egypt so that he could give us this land he had promised to our ancestors. And he has commanded us to obey all of these laws and to reverence him so that he can preserve us alive as he has until now. For it always goes well with us when we obey all the laws of the Lord our God.","You must obey all the commandments of the Lord your God, following his directions in every detail, going the whole way he has laid out for you; only then will you live and lead prosperous lives in the land you are to enter and possess.","If you obey all of my commandments, I will give you regular rains, and the land will yield bumper crops, and the trees will be loaded with fruit long after the normal time! And grapes will still be ripening when sowing time comes again. You shall eat your fill, and live safely in the land, for I will give you peace, and you will go to sleep without fear.

You will have such a surplus of crops that you won’t know what to do with them when the new harvest is ready! And I will live among you, and not despise you. I will walk among you and be your God, and you shall be my people. For I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, so that you would be slaves no longer; I have broken your chains so that you can walk with dignity.","When the Lord brings you into the Promised Land, as he soon will, he will destroy the following seven nations, all greater and mightier than you are: the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Cannanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, the Jebusites.","But if you will not listen to me or obey me, but reject my laws, this is what I will do to you: I will punish you with sudden terrors and panic, and with tuberculosis and burning fever; your eyes shall be consumed and your life shall ebb away; you will sow your crops in vain, for your enemies will eat them. I will set my face against you and you will flee before your attackers; those who hate you will rule you; you will even run when no one is chasing you!","And if you still disobey me, I will punish you seven times more severely for your sins. I will break your proud power and make your heavens as iron, and your earth as bronze. Your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its crops, nor your trees their fruit.","And if even then you will not obey me and listen to me, I will send you seven times more plagues because of your sins.

I will destroy your food supply so that one oven will be large enough to bake all the bread available for ten entire families; and you will still be hungry after your pittance has been doled out to you.","And if you still won’t listen to me or obey me, then I will let loose my great anger and send you seven times greater punishment for your sins. You shall eat your own sons and daughters, and I will destroy the altars on the hills where you worship your idols, and I will cut down your incense altars, leaving your dead bodies to rot among your idols; and I will abhor you.

And I am neither afraid nor ashamed to say that I share his enthusiasm for the Vedanta, and feel indebted to it for much that has been helpful to me in my passage through life. The Upanishads are the…. sources of … the Vedanta philosophy, a system in which human speculation seems to me to have reached its very acme. I spend my happiest hours in reading Vedantic books. They are to me like the light of the morning, like the pure air of the mountains - so simple, so true, if once understood.","Formulating his admiration for the Hindu thought and culture, he further said that, there is, in fact, an unbroken continuity between the most modern and the most ancient phases of Hindu thought, extending to over more than three thousand years. If we were to look over the whole world to find out the country most richly endowed with all the wealth, power and beauty that nature can bestow – in some parts a very paradise on earth – I should point to India. If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered over the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant - I should point to India. And if I were to ask myself from what literature we here in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw the corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more universal, in fact more truly human a life, not for this life only, but a transfigured and eternal life - again I should point to India","Romain Rolland, who followed him, was no less eloquent: “If there is one place on the face of the earth where all the dreams of living men have found a home from the very earliest days when man began the dream of existence, it is India.","G. W. Russell, the Irish poet, privy to the power of inspiration said about the inspiring value of the ancient Hindu scriptures: “Goethe, Wordsworth, Emerson and Thoreau among moderns have something of this vitality and wisdom, but we can find all they have said and much more in the grand sacred books of the East. The Bhagavad-Gita and the Upanishads contain such godlike fullness of Wisdom on all things that I feel the authors must have looked with calm remembrance back through a thousand passionate lives, full of feverish strife for and with shadows, ere they could have written with such certainty of things which the soul feels to be sure."

491608__puppets-of-faith-theory-of-communal-strife,"There was much in common between Buddhism and Jainism. Both were started by members of the kshatriya caste and were opposed to brahmanical orthodoxy, denying the authority of the Vedas, and antagonistic to the practice of animal sacrifices, which had by now become a keystone of brahmanical power. Both appealed to the socially downtrodden, the vaishyas who were economically powerful, but were not granted corresponding social status, and the shudras who were obviously oppressed. Buddhism and Jainism, though they did not directly attack the caste system, were nevertheless opposed to it and can, to that extent, be described as non-caste movements. This provided an opportunity for those of low caste to opt out of their caste by joining a non-caste sect. The lack of expenses involved in worship, as contrasted with brahmanical worship, also attracted the same stratum in society.","The successful attack of the ‘heretical sects’ on Vedic sacrifices and gods strengthened the trend of monotheistic thinking in brahmanical teaching, which trend had originated in the philosophy of the Upanishads with its concept of the Absolute or the Universal Soul.  This concept also resulted in the idea of the trinity of gods at this time, with Brahma as the Creator, Vishnu as the Preserver, and Shiva as the god who eventually destroys the universe when it is evil-ridden. This concept was associated with the cyclical conception of nature where creation, preservation, and destruction were seen as the natural order of things. Of the three gods, Vishnu and Shiva gained a vast following and through ensuing centuries the Vaishnavas and the Shaivas remained the two main sects of Hindu belief, each believing that its god represented the Absolute. Brahma receded into the background."

That forbids us to go into the wastelands and hunt them down and bring them here.","We have all lost loved ones. We have all lost friends. To sickness, disease, violence, old age.",It is the greatest mystery of our society. How do we heal? How do we mend a broken body?,I lost my life partner to the sickness. I watched her die a terrible death. I watched our children die from the same wretched illness. You have all lost loved ones. You have all suffered. But we must be strong and we must resist the temptation to use these creatures. They have been banished into the wasteland to live with their own kind – the kind that want to take what you have and will kill you for it. Pure Ones will not keep you safe. We will keep you safe.,"Chancellor Facundo. Calm, please. Yes, they were dark days. Facundo repealed our ancient laws and allowed the use of Pure Ones. He fixed a bounty on their heads and we lost hundreds of citizens who went into the wasteland to hunt them down. Production suffered. And what happened once they lived amongst us? What happened? Anarchy. Violence. Blood. Betrayal.","Greed. At first, Facundo healed everyone. No one was sick. No one died. Chett was a paradise. But then greed was spawned. A price had to be paid. And the price grew higher and higher and greater and greater. And ugly betrayal showed its face as citizens began to trade anything, including the lives of others, to be healed. This is why we have the law. This is why we have to survive without them. This is why you must not allow the SOT to bring these …"

The assassin had a poor aim.,"That was impressive shooting, Major. You killed the man who attempted to assassinate the Chancellor.","Is there something you wish to say, Gozan?","That would be First Minister Gozan and General of the Red Guard Gozan. Please remember that, Major.",I imagine it would be now quite impossible to investigate a Red Guard Major who has just saved the life of the Chancellor.,"I’m not sure I understand you, First Minister.",I think the people have seen enough excitement for one day.,I agree. And I would recommend that the Chancellor is removed from the House of Leadership and placed into safety at Quinto.,"I would agree with that recommendation, Major."

What do you suppose the lights mean?,"In the sky? I have no idea. Those questions are beyond me, I’m afraid.",And where do they hide during the day?,Some things are adept at hiding in plan view.,I thought the Chancellor’s speech was very stirring. Despite the outcome.,"Indeed, he lays the blame for everything at the feet of the SOT and the people hate them. Are you ready?",Yes.,Good. We have to accelerate everything. Time is against us.,"I won’t let you down, sir. I haven’t yet.",No. You haven’t. You’ve been perfect.

Gozan claimed we had wiped them all out.,Maybe we didn’t.,How can you know either way? They don’t walk around with a sign on their head.,But they’ve never tried to kill a Chancellor before. The worst crime they do is petty vandalism.,You sound like you’re sticking up for them. Are you one of them?,"That’s rubbish, but some of what they say makes sense to …",What was that?,What?,I thought I heard…

Not looking for any trouble, son.",You alone?,"I am, looks like you’re not. Evening, miss.",We could cook you and eat you.,"I don’t think you’re the type. You want this place, fine.

Where are we really going?,She knows.,What’s going on with you people? Maybe I should just clear out of …,Quiet.,"I should have known. I was so stupid to trust you both. It wasn’t luck that you were holed up in that building. You were waiting for me, weren’t you? I knew it. I knew it all along but I couldn’t get my head round it. You knew those men were hunting me. Were you following them whilst they were following me? I should have seen it. Why didn’t I see it?","And you, pretending you didn’t know who they were. You must have known they were Red Guard all along? So is there a bounty on my head? Are you taking me back to Chett to collect a bounty?","Red Guard? What Red Guard?

There are no laws out here.",I don’t understand any of this.,"Nearly fifty, sixty nights ago. We came across a man hiding out in the city. He was wounded. He looked like a bandit so we left him. Then he produced papers and begged us to take him home. He was a soldier in the Red Guard, a Sergeant. He said he was part of a group that were hunting for Pure Ones. The reward was a life pass. A place called Hamble Towers. He said that by the time anyone returned, if anyone returned, the law would be changed and that Pure Ones would be allowed to be used once again to heal people.

You saved mine.",I wish I hadn’t.,You get us into the city.,Chancellor Jorann would never approve this. I remember him before I left.,"I don’t know who he is. A major named Nuria organised the soldiers and a man named Gozan has offered the bounty. That was what the Sergeant told us. Bring a Pure One to Chett and live a life of luxury.

But we’ve been here for a long time. Ain’t got no fancy walls and pretty boys in uniforms like the big city Chett but we ain’t none too stupid.

I am very impressed.","I have decided to go around your town but we need to refuel our vehicles and take some rest.

We have many things to trade.,"We got a few shops that’ll like that. Ain’t got no black energy for your metal. Got a bar. Even got a school for the little ones if you want to leave any behind. Got a few books, can give them an education. No more than four of your boys at a time. You get me, Mr Cleric?","I am not, Mr Cleric. Or a Cleric.

We have to make the difficult decisions.,"You witnessed the hangings this morning, Mason. Chancellor Jorann’s killers are dead and the SOT is a fractured mess.

He couldn’t understand how we had some things but not others; do you know what I mean? Weapons that could kill, rip a man in half, but we couldn’t save a life. When my Grandma died it really made him sad. He would spend all his time talking about the past. He got killed when bandits raided us three years ago. A lot of people round here got killed then. He left this to me. Told me if anything happened to him I should take care of it. Give it onto my kids. Said it was the past. Things that used to be.

Bullets, bows, those metal machines. That’s not power. Not real power. They’re lost, all of them. Round and round in circles. This is the key to everything. This is ultimate power.

You named it after the town. I mean, you only had to think of a name for it, that’s not too hard, is it?","A name, just a name.",Maybe you should leave.,"I am, I’m getting out of here. I’ve got a lot of miles to cover and I won’t ever be back here again. That was my job. Map Gallen. Make maps and take them back to Chett. Why? Why should I give them my work?

I kept heading in the same direction but it was hopeless. I had no way of finding them. We had been tracking towards a city …",A city?,What city?,"A dead place, sir, not like Chett. It was a ruin. Everything old and fallen down, skeletons on the ground, it was a horrible place. I hoped to rejoin my unit there. I thought at one point I had found them but I was attacked by a couple of scavengers and by the time I had killed them there was no trace.",What unit were you assigned to?,"He was sent out six weeks ago. Under Captain Adam, soldiers Hugo and Rafa.","As I said, sir, I thought I had a line on them but it was a false alarm. I then heard gunfire somewhere in the city. I tried to locate it, but I was too far away. This city, sir, it was the size of Chett, or bigger even, roads and buildings; I had no idea who had been firing. Then I picked up the tracks of a couple men and a girl. It was night and they became involved in a heavy firefight. I didn’t know if any of them had survived.",Who were they?,"Drifters, I guess. In the morning, I spotted the three of them leaving the city. There were dead raiders everywhere.",Impressive. And the girl?,She was what you sent us for.,Describe her to me.,"The road gang, the ones they fought with the night before, they returned that morning, in greater numbers. I didn’t have enough firepower to take them on. There was more shooting and then the gang left, leaving behind bodies and dirt bikes. I had to wait for the area to clear and by that time the girl and the two men had gone in a stolen jeep. I took a bike and followed them east. They were heading this way. Three or four days, maybe, in a vehicle, and I reckon they would have got here. I kept riding but I never came across them. But they have her, sir, and they must be close. With a large party of men I think we could …","Soldier, remember your place. Go and clean up. And get some sleep.","One last question, Bramble, who were these men?","One was young, sir, average build, fought with a crossbow and pistol. The other, a big man, older, had a long coat and hat. Shot with a rifle. These men knew how to handle themselves, sir.",So these healers still exist? And we have two drifters holding onto one of them.,What have you done?,Is it really that important?

567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,Powerful?,No. I feel sadness. A wretched sadness that only an older man can feel for a dead friend.,"Chancellor Jorann was a remarkable leader, sir.","He was an awful leader. I thought you were a perceptive young man, Mason. Jorann was a terrible Chancellor. A puppet figure head for fifteen years whilst … he was a superb First Minister, honest and fair, but a hopeless, bloated, lovesick Chancellor.","I think he was a good Chancellor, sir. Yes, he had his failings, he was soft when a firm hand was required although, to be honest, this came more in his later years than his early terms.","Nothing is certain with Chett politics, Mason. I admire your courage to speak your thoughts. I do not want a yes-man as a First Minister. Nor was I testing you. Jorann was a foolish Chancellor … but he was a good friend. I miss my dear friend. I do not miss my Chancellor.","Now, this delicate matter, approach it.","As you alluded to earlier, sir, I do have spies and contacts within the city. They feed me information, sometimes useful, sometimes not. I think it best to build a picture of people, rather than the one they want you to see. My father, former Third Minister, taught me that.",I am horrified that our Chancellor was assassinated and that many soldiers and servants lost their lives protecting him.,You … were … always …,"… minor rumblings of discontent, yes. There are complaints of rigid routine, unfairness, a stifling of freedom, but these murmurings have never been tainted with such ruthless and cold blooded violence …","You are not in Progress Square.

Tell me what you know.","It’s difficult, sir.",Why is it difficult?,"Collusion, sir.",Collusion?,"Yes, sir?",Between?,The SOT and a high level officer in the Red Guard. With access to weapons and the ability to turn rabble into terrorists.,"We hanged SOT murderers this morning, Mason. Only last week we netted the core of the SOT. I don’t understand the point you’re attempting to make here.","A senior officer, sir, has been seen visiting a suspected SOT safe house, here within the city, under our …","Did you hear that, sir?",Hear what?

567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,I don’t believe it.,Why?,Why go to these lengths?,"Chancellor Facundo understood this very well. Men need to hate, Mason. Men need to blame. Years ago, when the desert raiders attacked us, day after day, scaling the walls, firing into the city, killing and maiming – who did we hate then? We hated them and we blamed them for what they inflicted upon our perfect society. Your father stood in the House of Leadership. He understood hate. You are very young. A smart suit. A charming joke in the office with the junior ministers. Do you think that is all it takes? You will be up to your arms in blood and filth in this position, Mason. It takes a man to be First Minister. Even more to be Chancellor. I thought I saw it in you. Was I wrong?"
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,"We beat them back, our brave Red Guard soldiers, but Facundo knew it wasn’t enough, we all knew they would be back so we rode out into the wastelands and hunted them down, every last one of them. Jorann was my General and I was his Captain. We had horses then. Not these dreadful bicycles. We found their villages and camps and burnt them to the ground. We killed them. The men, the women, the children … we spared no one.","That’s enough. Captain Gozan, leave some of them alive … not the children … spare some of the children…","But that wasn’t enough for Chett. Men need to hate. Need to blame. Facundo focused our citizens against those who among us looked different, the disfigured, the oddities. He poured the blame on them. It was easy. They became shunned and despised until Facundo exiled them from within our walls. And then there was calm. But Facundo had learned of the Pure Ones, the deformed with this … this incredible gift and he was filled with regret for banishing them. He had no idea that amongst these … these different people … were the greatest gifts to Gallen. His greed for power and control tore Chett apart. It was a savage and dark time for our city. Now, Chett needs the Pure Ones again. We cannot allow our people to keep dying. Sickness will devastate us unless we can fight it. Pure Ones are the way. The only way. Facundo handled it badly. We will not. Once the law is repealed, Pure Ones will be welcomed back into our city to help our sick and our dying.",Facundo used the Pure Ones for the powerful. The common citizens were never able to afford his charges. How will it be any different this time?,"Understand me, General, I love my city. What I do, what I have done, has always been for Chett.",But the SOT?,Pure fiction. An invention. Men need to hate.,"But, sir, who were those men and women we executed this morning? Who have we been arresting?","Often, no one. We tell our citizens what to think and feel, Mason. Today, we told them that the group responsible for murdering the former Chancellor have been punished. Now they will be relieved and they will return to work happy that justice has been served. Tomorrow production will rise and once again Chett will continue to turn.","They were innocent. We executed innocent people this morning, didn’t we?",Is this a problem for you? The people need to believe in the SOT. Believe in them so they can fear them and hate them.,Fear them?,"But why this way? I can’t, I really am struggling with this, sir, I am sorry.","Sir, I am a loyal Minister, but … why do we need them to hate and blame? What are we so afraid of?","Who do you think they will hate, Mason? Without the desert raiders or the deformed or the SOT? Who? Who?",Us.,"Yes. The SOT are fake, Mason, we use them to misdirect out citizen’s opinions. Life is hard here in Chett. Jorann never understood how hard it really is for people. He felt that if you were kept safe that was all there should be. People want more. They crave more. The SOT are the reason people do not have more.","Sir, if the SOT is not real, then who did murder Chancellor Jorann?","General, I think First Minister Mason is tired. He has been drinking. Place him in detention for a few days. Let the fog clear in his head.",And make sure you return here afterwards.
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,How dare you question me?,I am your superior. I am Chancellor of this city and you will obey my rules.,"I told that idiot what he needed to hear. He has the potential to make a good First Minister, once he can get his brain around how Chett really works.",And when he realises you have lied? Will he be executed? Like the rest?,"You are bordering on treason, Nuria, please be very careful.",General Nuria. Chancellor Gozan.,I care about this city. I will keep this city alive. The Pure One will heal the sick and the dying. What is wrong with that?,Is that really why you are doing this? We killed the Chancellor. We gunned him down in cold blood together. We are murderers. All because he wouldn’t change a law? How have I been so blind to you?,"You don’t care about the people, do you? I mean, not really. It’s the power. It has always been about the power.",Silence.,You controlled your life partner until she died. You control and bully everyone around you. Shape decisions and lives.,And your point is?,"It means I don’t believe in you anymore, Chancellor. Your time is coming to an end."

567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,What have you been stirring up?,I had to stand in front of the mob and plead for them to return to work. How did these rumours get out? Did you start them?

You killed everyone …",I don’t care.,Who are you? I need to know who you are.,Why?,I want to go with you.,You’re not coming with us.,Stone. We need to go now; we really need to get out of here.,She’ll cut our throats the moment we sleep.,If I stay I hang for treason. The House of Leadership is dead but at Hamble Towers there are powerful men still alive. If Gozan was telling the truth and Facundo is there then we all need to get far away from here. The people hated him. This city will erupt.,You might as well shoot me. I’d prefer a bullet than a noose.,Try anything and you die.
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,No.,Who are they?,The Cleric.
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,"This belonged to my warriors, the ones I sent after you, Tongueless Man.",Who are they?,"If this car is here. Then you are here, here with your little family of freaks.","Will you face me, Tongueless Man?","You killed many of my warriors back in Ford and you killed my woman, Bann. I miss her dearly.","Well, show yourself, Tongueless Man, legend of the wasteland. Isn’t that what they call you?","Give me the mutant, and I will spare your life. Gallen is not for her. She is a thing. To be destroyed. Gallen is a beautiful place …",Go back to Chett. This isn’t your world.

567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,I ask you again. Do you have a name?,Tomas.,Hmmm. A strange name.,Miles in that direction are hundreds of armed men. Preparing to move on your rabble.,Men with guns. And armour. Men who have been trained to kill. What have you got compared to that? A couple of bashed up cars and a few bows and arrows? I reckon you should turn and run whilst you can.,You are very brave. Where are these men with guns? I cannot see them.,I still cannot see them. Where are these heroes with guns and armour?,I am the only hero here. Cleansing Gallen of those who do not belong. Put her in my vehicle but tie her up. You will be my new woman.,You have spirit.

Not with this trash.,Burn him with the rest.,"Captain, I‘m ordering you to take that man’s body back to the city.","No more orders, General. That man was responsible for over twenty deaths. He burns with the rest of them.",I am the senior military commander in Chett. There is no ministerial authority left in the city and I am taking temporary control until we can work a way forward.,First Minister Mason has already assumed control. Until we can work a way forward.
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,"I’m very sorry about Gozan, I know you were close. You witnessed it?",Yes.,I can’t imagine how horrific that must have been. Captain Andozini walked me through the building.,I never made it into the Chancellor’s office. Bodies and blood everywhere. These men are monsters. I cannot begin to fathom why this attack happened.,The bearded man spoke to Gozan before he was shot by the girl.,"Captain Andozini, can you fetch us both some drinking water. It’s very hot and uncomfortable in here. Yes, I will be fine. Please make sure the water is cold and fresh.","There is talk you are a traitor. That you are a leader within the SOT. How can this be? You and Gozan told me the SOT was a fictitious organisation, engineered to cause resentment in the city, but the streets are filled with real members. What is going on? Nuria, please, you must tell me everything. There are hundreds of them out there. Too many to be a false government group. There are genuine protests and I have some very angry people making a lot of demands. They want new laws, new rights, and the freedom to choose ministers. Can you imagine that? Citizens selecting who is in charge. It’s anarchy out there. They’re real, aren’t they? You fooled Gozan into believing he was orchestrating a fake group when, in fact, you forged a real one. That’s right, isn’t it?","I am the only one left now. Chett is hanging by a thread. Gozan told me the balance was delicate, that one man or one woman could tip it. This bearded man has certainly tipped the scales one way. I need you to help me tip it back.","Captain, I have to discuss matters of high security with General Nuria. I need you to be outside for the time being.",Yes?,"First Minister. We have made over a hundred arrests this morning for damage to factory machinery, destruction of bicycles, incitement … my men are responding to every incident but we … I need to know what we are fighting for. If you are all that’s left then …","Yes, Captain. You’re right, I am all that’s left, which means you need to follow your orders and contain the situation. Arrest on sight any SOT protestors. Update me one hour from now.",And is General Nuria still in command of the Red Guard? Because there is a lot of …,"Captain, carry out your orders. Keep the people safe. Do whatever is required.",Can I take the extra men posted at Hamble Towers?,Extra men? What extra men?,"The General’s orders, First Minister.",With the House under attack. I assumed Hamble Towers might be next. A lot of powerful men reside there.,"An update in one hour, Captain. And take the extra men from the Towers. Ensure all the regular security is on duty."
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,"For the last time, Nuria, you have to tell me everything. I can help you but I have to know everything. I was disgusted with Gozan’s methods and I am sorry I reported you to him.",That showed guts. It’s what you should have done. What is happening to the prisoners?,I understand the man is being questioned. I think we both know what that means.,And the girl?,She has been placed in a solitary cell. She scares the men. She is a very odd thing.,Do you believe I am a traitor?,"Yes, I do. Though I agree with your motives, just not your methods and actions. I think Gozan truly loved our city and I think you do as well. We both know there are things wrong here. These people have nothing. What is their life? To work hard and watch the convoys cycle over to Hamble Towers? Have you ever been inside Hamble Towers, Nuria? They serve real food there. Sliced halk. And gleff. Have you ever tasted gleff? They cook gleff in a kitchen. A kitchen. And where does that come from? There are no pastures here where animals graze.",The Supply Expeditions. I know. We range a long way to hunt them.,"Do you think any of those luxuries are found inside a Citizen Parcel? Exactly, you and I both know the answer to that question.","Then you agree with the SOT? These are the topics were argue and protest over, Mason. We want to be heard. We need to be heard.","But they are dissidents, separatists …","Can we stop painting each other with names? Mason, you have an opportunity to take Chett into a new age. Can you understand what is happening? We are stagnant. It’s the same day over and over again for so many years. Nothing is ever different. Gozan said Chett keeps turning. Maybe it needs to stop. The deaths today, the murders at the House, yes they are truly awful, but with Gozan and the ministers gone, there is an open door for a different way. Sit down with the SOT. Listen to them. Are you going to run this city alone? If you don’t trust me, fine, but sit down with the SOT. They have good ideas. We have good ideas. I am a loyal officer, Mason, and I would never betray the city. I just don’t agree with the way we run it.","Captain Andozini mentioned a third conspirator, what happened to him?",He was killed. Outside. By raiders. A tribe called the Blood Sun. A man named the Cleric killed him.,So these men were part of a tribe? Are they planning to attack again? Because we are being pulled …
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,Stone suggested he was a child from one of these camps and witnessed the slaughter of his family.,But you left with them?,I wanted to run.,"All what you just told me about how much you care about this city, why would you run?",What are you planning to do with them both?,The man and the freak will hang.,"Gozan committed some very terrible crimes, Mason. Please don’t make the same mistakes.","I have over twenty murders, Nuria. What do you suggest, I reward them?","No, use him.",Who?,Stone.
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,They’re going to hang you. You and the girl.,Was Gozan responsible for the deaths of your family?,You addressed him as a Captain. This must have happened a very long time ago. Before I was born. Is that what you meant when you said I kept your name?,I’m sorry for what happened to you.,I can get you out of here. You and the girl.,Is this why they call you the Tongueless Man? The silence you keep? Let me tell you that after tomorrow it won’t matter either way. They’ll hang you both and burn your bodies.,I kept his name.,It means I never forgot. I was eight years old he came.,"General Jorann, Captain Gozan. I had a father, a mother, a sister.",He butchered them all.,"…  we rode out into the wastelands and hunted them down, every last one of them. Jorann was my General and I was his Captain. We had horses then … we found their villages and settlements and burnt them to the ground. We killed them. The men, the women, the children … we spared no one.",I am so very sorry.,Why?,For what he took from you.,I’m not afraid to die.,You look cold.,They burnt your friend.,Put him with all the other bodies.,I don’t want them to hang you. I can make a deal to get you both out of these cells and out of the city.,"Well, shall I make the deal?",I’m not going to let either of you die. You achieved more in a few hours than years of sitting around a table talking.,Do you want to see the other one?,No. And get him some clothes.
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,I can name Chancellor Jorann’s killer. But I want you to release both the prisoners to me. I will take them from the city. Myself as well.,"No. No, that is not a deal I will make with you.",We know two masked men were involved.,Search Gozan’s private rooms. You should find the weapons there. He was one of the gunman.,And the other?,I don’t know.,It was you. Wasn’t it?
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,"When I was assigned to head up the Chancellor’s fake organisation, I hand picked my team, personnel that I could trust. At first, we created minor rumblings within the city, distributing literature, small acts of vandalism, heckling at assemblies. We would then arrest citizens who were poor workers or had health problems or leanings towards violence. They would be exiled or placed in cells for a period of time, punished for the crimes we had committed. Sometimes they were hanged. People grew to hate the unrest the SOT caused, the distress, and the imbalance. Gozan was pleased. Chancellor Jorann became gravely concerned and instructed him to hunt them down and dismantle this rebellious network. He tasked the man responsible for creating the SOT with destroying them.","But it soured. It had changed us. The rebellion we spoke of, we began to talk at length about it. And so we formed the real SOT. Not all of us were part of this second organisation. And now we intended to cause real unrest. We wanted citizens to stop and think and look at how little freedom they had. Ministers told them what to think and feel … why are you smiling?",Something Gozan said. He told me we should always tell our citizens what to think and feel.,"Our numbers grew. Minister Pondly was our most prominent member. It’s a shame he died today. He helped engineer the work withdrawals. We became a group no longer made up of disillusioned military. So it was agreed, sometime ago, that I should work much more closely to Gozan. Follow in his corrupt footsteps. The goal was to expose him but he was a very clever man, Mason, you have to understand how hard it was to break him open. I had to become his shadow. I had to prove myself as evil as he was.",So you agreed to kill Chancellor Jorann to convince him of your loyalty?,You were the second assassin?,Yes.
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,"I don’t think you need to tell me anything more, Nuria. Tonight, I will go into Progress Square and offer myself as the new Chancellor. If the people want me.",And if they don’t?,Then tomorrow we enter a new age. Just as you said.,I want a deal.,The prisoners hang in the morning. Nothing will change my mind on that.
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,No. I’m sorry. I don’t understand why you want to help two cold blooded killers.,"Because they did what we only ever dreamed of doing, Mason. They tore it all down and now you have to start again.",I can make you the most loved Chancellor in our city’s history.,How can you say that? I might not be Chancellor. If we follow the SOT and give the citizens an election they might not choose me.,"Let them have an election. Insist on it. But I can still promise you a victory, no matter who stands against you.",How?
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,"That’s my offer. Ex-Chancellor Facundo, convicted of hundreds of crimes, for the lives of the two assassins.",The people will be in outrage.,"The people will not care. You need to wake up, Mason. Give the people the most wretched criminal this city has ever known. Worse than any desert raider that has knocked at our gates. Worse than the killers you want to hang.",And he’s here?,He never left.,Where is he?
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,"I need a guarantee first. All three of us; clothes,  weapons, provisions.",Go on.,You also need to release them tonight.,Why don’t I march over to Hamble Towers right now? Take Captain Andozini and a detail of men and flush him out?,The unit who guard Hamble are elite security. They were all recruited by Gozan when he held the rank of General.,Loyal to Facundo? What kind of a man was Gozan? I am so … frustrated by all this. Bodies everywhere and now I have to let the killers go?,If you present Facundo to the people. They will follow you. No matter what the SOT want.,"So your true colours are shinning through. You don’t really care about the SOT, do you? You just want to run.","You’re wrong. I want you to listen to them, and bring them into the House of Leadership … but someone has to lead, Mason."
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,"Can you believe it? The rubbish they send you out on. I mean, how can you reach your targets? I’m going to be stuck here again.",Go find a mechanic. You must know them all by name.
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,"Hey, have you seen … oh, it’s you. Can you believe I’m still trying to find a mechanic. I could spend half a morning in here looking for one. Did you hear me back there? I got a flat. That drives me mad. They never check the tyres properly at the factory. I mean, they give you targets but …","Are you okay? I mean, you look a bit roughed up. Were you out smashing everything up last night? You know, I’ve never seen you before. I know all the riders. Maybe I should go and get …"

567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,What do you want?,"You both hang in the morning. I’ve made a deal so that you can leave the city instead, as exiles. I’ll be exiled as well. We all have to leave together.",What deal?
567057__a-fractured-world-the-wasteland-soldier-1,Bring him out of there alive. That’s the deal.,And they let us go?,Yes.,"Facundo for your freedom. Stone, listen to me, Stone, please.

Now that prophesy hangs in the balance, and Alcyoneus fights to free himself from his chains. Only you can put this right. I cannot help you, but I can tell you how you can help yourself. You must go to Troezen and offer yourself as a servant to Pittheus, the philosopher king. You will serve him for a year and a day, and he will give you twelve challenges. If you complete the challenges in the time given then the prophesy will be fulfilled and the world will be saved. If you fail, or the year and the day run out, then Alcyoneus will break free from his chains. He will destroy the gods and leave the earth in ruins.","Wake up lazy, I’ve been up for hours, and I’ve got a fire going already.

What are you doing here?,"I do apologise for this trickery, but it was necessary for a greater purpose.","You see, I prayed to Zeus for a hero to help me with a certain problem. He then appeared to me in a dream and told me that, if I went out into the wilderness, a hero would appear. The disguise was my idea. Once I realised that the hero was Hercules, I had to be sure that you were no longer under the power of the madness before I could reveal myself to you.","That explains why you were so heavy for an old woman. Now, to business. You see, Zeus also appeared to me in a dream. I therefore offer myself to you as your servant for a year and a day. I stand ready to complete your twelve challenges.","Twelve? There’s a mystery, for I have only one. No doubt mighty Zeus can see other troubles in my future. But please, don’t stay standing now.

Why do you not celebrate?","I do not celebrate because my task is not yet complete. Pittheus instructed me to bring the lion’s skin back to the city, so that everyone can see that it is dead. I’ve tried to skin the animal, but every knife I had has crumpled against its impregnable hide. I do not know how I will be able to succeed."

However, I can cut a new club from any olive tree I pass. The chances of my finding another invulnerable lion on my journey are quite small.","Can you drive a chariot? Go back to the baths and collect my cloak, then borrow the fastest chariot you can find and see if you can catch me up. I will be taking the road to Lerna"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,That must be its lair.,"Wait, that cloak of yours will protect you from any weapon, but how will it save you from a cave full of poison gas? Here, I brought some fire arrows. Take one and shoot it deep into the cave. That should force the beast out into the open."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Are you alright?,"I’m fine, a little dust but that’s all. What have you been up to?","These have been dipped in the Hydra’s blood. It is a deadly poison and the merest scratch from one of these arrows will kill instantly, You might want to be careful with them."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Hercules, brother.",I almost had you that time.,"You would have to be a lot quicker than that to catch me out, But enough of this merriment. I have come from Olympus with a serious purpose. Very serious indeed, because it comes from father Zeus himself, and also because it involves a hunt ..."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Are you listening to me?,"Yes, sister.","I found the story of your childhood fascinating. I had no idea that your silver bow was made by the Cyclops, or that the goat-god Pan gave you your hunting dogs, or that Zeus himself gave you every mountain in the world for your home -","Except Olympus, of course.","Ah, so you were listening, but I can see your attention wanders easily, so I will get to the point. When I was still just a girl, I was out hunting wild boar in Thessaly, and I came across five hinds – which are female deer. These were no ordinary hinds. Each one was as big as a bull, with golden horns and bronze hooves. I immediately decided that I would have these beautiful creatures to pull my chariot. I put aside my bow and arrows and began to stalk them. In just a short time I had managed to capture four of them, bringing them down, one by one, with my bare hands, but the fifth one escaped. The last I saw of it, it was heading towards the Ceryneian Hills and -","Got it. Say no more. I understand. Huge monstrous deer with deadly, sharp antlers and armoured, crushing hooves terrorising the countryside around Ceryne. Don’t worry about a thing, once I cut myself a new club you can consider it dead …","Oh Hercules! I sometimes wonder if there’s more wood in your club or in your head. Father Zeus does not mean for you to kill this hind. In fact, you must not harm a hair on its head. It is simply that he observed the slow progress of your chariot, on your trip to Lerna, and has decided that you need faster transportation for the challenges ahead. Remember, if you do not complete the twelve challenges within a year and a day then Alcyoneus will break free and destroy the world. So, Hercules, your third challenge is to capture the Ceryneian Hind. She will draw your chariot until your labours are complete, and then she will have her freedom of the parks of Troezen.","Don’t bother, my next challenge is of a different nature.","Well, I’m glad I made a start on our provisions, I’d better go and get the chariot back. Then we’ll need something to use to catch the deer. How about a net?","No good, I’ve seen animals badly injured through struggling in a net. Snares won’t work either. We mustn’t hurt this hind in any way, it is a gift from Zeus. Rope, I think, would be best. Why don’t you get some, gather our other provisions and then catch me up. I’ll be …",… on the Ceryneian road. I know.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Go to the town, and replenish our supplies. I will go and capture the hind. Near here there is a mountain called Mount Artemisium, in honour of my sister. At the base of this mountain is a ford across the river Ladon. Wait for me there, and I will find you when I have captured the hind - probably tomorrow or the next day.",But master. what if it is not as easy as you think?,"Nonsense, Artemis, when she was just a girl, caught four deer just like this one in a matter of minutes."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Last night, there was a terrible thunderstorm over the city. Lightning struck many buildings, and in some places this started fires that, mercifully, the citizens were able to control. When the storm died down, and we were finally able to sleep, the great god Zeus appeared to me in my dreams. Zeus said that he was displeased by the way in which you captured the hind. The weapons and practice of war, he said, had led you to madness and put the whole world at risk. The fact that you could not complete this last challenge without using your bow shows how little you have learnt and how much of the journey is left ahead.","What would Zeus have me do, I have captured the hind and completed the challenge. I used the skills that I have and solved the problem in my own way, what’s wrong with that?"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Was anyone hurt?,"There were some slight burns, one man had his arm broken, but on the whole we were very lucky.","We were lucky, this time. Now it is time we made our own luck. Hercules, although I don’t hold you responsible for our ill fortune, I cannot let you enter the city. Many of the citizens think that it would bring the wrath of Zeus down upon us once more and, who knows, they might be right."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,What must I do?,"Your fourth challenge, is to capture the Erymanthian Boar and to do so without the use of weapons. You must return the boar to Troezen, unharmed, and we will make a home for it in the city parks."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,May I enter the city? I would like to gather provisions for our journey. Let me take the chariot and go to the city. You start off and I’ll catch you up.,"Not this time, I’ve had enough of stumbling around the woods looking for animals. This time I’m going to get some help. My friends the centaurs will know where to find this boar. They know all the forests and woods in this part of the world. However, they do not take kindly to strangers, so you should go straight to Erymanthus, while I go and meet the centaurs."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"My old friend, I know you’ve only come to visit because you need a favour, but I’m none the less glad to see you.","Cheiron, king of the centaurs, you are as direct and as wise as you always were. I do have a favour to ask, but I will take pleasure from your company even if the favour is not granted.","Then you had better join me in my cave, the night will soon be here and there is a fire inside. Tonight you shall be my guest."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"You know very well that it’s not allowed, I don’t know why you would suggest such a thing.","I only mentioned it, because you have a jar of wine in your cave. I thought that maybe the rules had changed.","No, the rules are the same and always will be, that single jar is allowed to remain here only because it was given to the centaurs by Dionysus himself, when he was our guest four years ago.","Dionysus did not leave this as a gift, he left it because he foresaw a time when a king and a hero would drink from it together.","Well, that settles it, for you are a king, and I am a hero. The god of wine has left this here for our enjoyment and in honour of my father, Zeus. It would be an insult to leave it untasted."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Good day to you. I am trying to find out where that stench is coming from, do you know anything about it?","Stench? Oh, that stench! You see, we get so used to it round here that we don’t notice it anymore, but now you mention it, the smell is particularly bad today.",But what is the cause? Is there some hideous monster? Maybe an entrance to the Underworld spewing fumes from the fires of Hades himself?,No monster or Underworld. just the dung from the cattle of the world’s richest man!
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"You must be up early every day, if you are not there to watch over them then the peasants will not do their work. They are lazy by nature, and if they were allowed, they’d turn me into a pauper by staying in bed late and avoiding their duties.","And who might you be? We have no charity for vagabonds in this town, if that’s what you’ve come for. People must work here if they want to be fed.","That’s good, because I’ve come to work. In fact, I’ve come to do the hardest day’s work that anyone in this kingdom has ever seen. I’ve seen that the land around here looks very good for farming, very valuable, except, except that no-one would part with a single copper coin for the whole kingdom, the way it is now. Who’d want fields that are knee deep in cow pats? Who could grow anything in that?"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"I can clear all the dung, from all the fields, and the stables too, and I’ll do it all before the sun sets today.",And what would you want in payment for this impossible task?,"If I succeed, I will take twenty of your cattle as payment, if I fail to complete the task before the end of the day then you owe me nothing."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"I agree, you may start whenever you are ready.","You, what is your name?",Phyleus.,"Then, Phyleus, you are witness to our bargain. You will see that I complete my part, and then you will make sure your father keeps his promise."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"He is damaging your property, he has broken down the wall around your stables, not just in one place but in two.",Saddle my horse! Where will I find this vandal now?
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Stop right there! you’ve done enough damage for one day.,"I wouldn’t stay there if I were you, it’s going to get very wet."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Very well, we will go and ask your son, Phyleus.",I have no son named Phyleus.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Wait We should take this to Pittheus, so that it can be studied. We need to know more about these things.","Take this and the farmer to the king, he will know what to do, I will stay and guard the gate until reinforcements arrive.","There was a third, be on your guard."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,The third has gone.,I wonder where?,Maybe it’s gone to get reinforcements as well.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"It seems that these birds are indeed made of metal, and they appear to be entirely mechanical, we waited to see if they would run out of power, but I’m afraid to say that they seem to be sustained by some kind of sorcery that is beyond our understanding. They might stay active forever. Their metal bodies are difficult to cut, so swords and spears are not very effective weapons against them. An arrow, if fired with enough strength, would pierce their armour, and as we’ve seen, they can be crushed or their necks can be broken … if you can catch them.",Where are you going? Your quick thinking and good sense might be needed here.,"I have a plan, I must start at once. Find me in the marketplace when you are ready to leave."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"These machines are perfect copies of real birds, maybe too perfect. They behave exactly as birds behave, except that they seem to be more aggressive. Maybe this is something we can use against them.","It is clear that we must rescue the family, and then we must rid this land of these cursed birds. Hercules, you have your next challenge. Captain, you will provide every assistance. Leave only enough men to guard the city, the rest are to be put at Hercules’ command. You will leave in the morning."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Don’t worry, son, without fear there is no bravery.","As we came down from the mountains, we had an excellent view over all of the swamp and to the sea beyond. It is clear that the swamp is where the birds have made their base. I saw at least a dozen myself, as they flew up above the blanket of mist. I thought of shooting them down with my bow, but they disappeared again too quickly.","So, we must go in and deal with them at close quarters, if we leave them here, then they will soon start to strike deeper into the kingdom, maybe in greater numbers.","We went into the swamp, by accident. The ground quickly becomes too waterlogged for a man to walk through, we would sink into the swamp and make easy targets."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"How would we have built a boat anyway. we’re soldiers, not carpenters!","That’s only partly true, we are a modern army and many of the men are trained in carpentry, and some in engineering. It there is a need, this body of men can build siege engines, forts and even bridges.",You could build a bridge across the swamp!,"The area of the swamp is too great, and it takes a long while to build a bridge. The birds would simply move to different areas of the swamp, where the bridge didn’t reach. We could drain the swamp, it might take months but it would be effective …","I’ve got a quicker way! Do you remember what you told me, Hercules? What one of the wise men said? About how these things were mechanical, but behaved just like real birds. Well, when I was a child and we wanted to drive away flocks of birds we’d use wooden rattles. They found the noise so frightening that they never came back to the same place again.","Do you think you could show my men how to make these rattles? We passed plenty of woods near here, and our carpenters work fast when they’re given a task."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Those things will remember this place, and this kingdom, I don’t think that they will ever dare to return. I feel now that I have played a worthy part in this challenge.","But, Hercules. do you not think Zeus will be angry with you for using your weapons again? Shouldn’t we just have let the birds fly away and make their home somewhere else?","You say ‘birds’, but they are not anything of the sort. I have harmed no living thing today, just evil machines that would have caused great suffering wherever they went. No, I do not fear the anger of Zeus. He too understands that not every challenge can be overcome by quick thinking and clever words."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"What’s the meaning of this, since when did the palace of Pittheus require a guard from Crete. Where are the men of our own land?","We’re here, sir!"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"The high ground seemed best, in case those birds decided to make another visit, but our new friends here were too proud to join us. They decided to stand very still, in the open, like great big shiny targets.","The ambassador of Crete is inside, we will protect the gate until he is ready to leave.","Your choice, just watch out for any deadly, mechanical, armoured birds. We think about a hundred of them got away."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"An ambassador from the island kingdom of Crete, maybe we should head for the throne room, this could be our next challenge.",I want every man cleaned up and ready for inspection. I want patrols on the streets to reassure the people. Tell those fools on the wall that the birds have gone. I want those salt slurpers to see what a real modern army looks like!
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Crete is an island kingdom, and they rule a large area because they are good sailors and build fine ships. No-one can match them at sea. The rumour is that they spend so much time at sea that they have learnt how to drink sea water.",But drinking sea water sends you mad!,"Well, some say that the Cretans have found the secret of drinking sea water and not going mad, so they call them ‘salt slurpers’.",And what do the others say?,"The others say that there is no secret and the sea water does send the Cretans mad, but, as they’re all mad to begin with, there’s no way to tell the difference!"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,I would like to raise a toast to … to ….,Your Excellency!,"I would like to raise a toast to Your Excellency, I would beg your forgiveness for my rustic ways and would wish you every happiness in your visit to Troezen. The baths are excellent!"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"His Excellency has not made a long journey, and taken time from his other important affairs, simply in order to enjoy a visit to our poor and simple city, he has come on important business, as a representative of King Minos himself, and this business involves you, Hercules. Your Excellency. might I prevail upon you to explain?","Hercules, you are greatly honoured."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"King Minos, the immortal and all powerful ruler of Crete, has decided to provide you with the opportunity of displaying your reverence for him by completing a challenge.","For some weeks now the countryside of Crete has been subject to attack and devastation by a bull of unnatural size, strength and abilities. The bull is pure white, as ferocious as Ares, the god of war, and capable of breathing fire. Of course, Minos could easily defeat even such a fearsome beast. Such a task would use only a fraction of his awesome power. But by extreme good fortune - on your part - the immortal king was brought word of your brave deeds, and he has decided to help you fulfil your quest by providing you with a challenge.","Your seventh challenge, is to kill the Cretan Bull and so spare the Minoans from further devastation."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,How do we get there? When do we start?,"You will have the honour of travelling in one of the mighty ships of the Minoan Navy, and we will set sail on the morning tide.","Well, Iolaus, we had better start our preparations, there is no time to lose.","King Minos has extended the invitation only to Hercules, I have instructions only to take one passenger.",It would be an unbearable dishonour if I were to undertake this challenge without my loyal and faithful -,- servant.,"You have been too generous, master, in allowing me to sit at table with you. The ambassador has misunderstood our relationship. I’m sure he would have no objection to a hero travelling with his manservant. Pray, continue your meal, master. I will make all the necessary arrangements and will come to wake you at first light."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,What do you mean by pretending to be my servant. I am honoured that you are my friend.,"Where we are going, they have no time for honour or friendship. They believe that some men are better than others, that some men should serve masters. Let’s pretend that we believe the same, so that they accept us more easily. It may be something to use to our advantage before the challenge is complete."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"King Minos is on the island of Crete, I am merely his humble ambassador, sent to Greece on a very minor matter of state.",Liar!,"I am an ambassador, you cannot hurt me, it would not be honourable.","Now you speak of honour, but what honour is there in your minor matter of state? You would fetch my nephew, in my own brother’s name, in order that he may kill my ambassador!",Uncle.,"Yes, yes, yes, of course I understand that you were all too easily tricked into this journey. Come, join me on my chariot, and I will try to explain things to you in a way that you will understand."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,A bull? That seems like an odd choice for an ambassador.,"Yes, I would have preferred to send a dolphin, much more intelligent you see, but Minos has his palace on the land so a sea creature would not do."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"It seems like such a simple plan, I can’t see how things could have gone wrong.","Precisely my thoughts, but I didn’t then understand the sheer wickedness of Minos, and his total lack of honour."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"I must go back to Troezen, I cannot complete the challenge if it means harming your ambassador and helping Minos.","Not so hasty, nephew, remember that I said you would complete the task, but not in the way Minos wants. You are not to kill the bull, although you must subdue him. Instead, the bull must be brought to Greece. It will be a sign that the time of Cretan dominance of the sea is almost at an end, and that a new power will arise to take their place.","That won’t be easy, I don’t think I’d want a ferocious, fire-breathing bull rampaging around my ship on a long voyage.","You and your mortal friend have solved trickier puzzles than this one. take this. It contains the song of the sea. If you hold it to the bull’s ear then he will know that you are acting on my instructions. After this the bull will be your friend and will follow your commands as eagerly as the most obedient horse. The rest is up to you. Now, hide the shell, we have almost returned to your ship."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"You’ll need help, evidently, so I will put all my armies under your command.","I don’t need your armies, they’ll only get in my way, they’ve been trying to catch the bull for weeks and have nothing to show for their ridiculous efforts. Why on earth do you think I’d want their help?","You insult my army? Very well, let’s see how you manage on your own. You’ll not receive an ounce of help from me. I shall simply wait for your burnt, blackened body to be brought before me, and if by some chance the bull does not kill you then good luck getting back to Greece, no Minoan ship will take you."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"So, once we’ve found and captured the bull, all we have to do is to sneak it off the island and back to Greece. Have you any idea how we do that?",Not a clue.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"I’ve asked everyone, and they all give the same story, no Cretan ship will dare risk displeasing Minos by taking us aboard. But not all the ships in the harbour are Cretan. There is one Greek ship, a trading galley, and the captain is willing to give us passage … for a fee.","We have no money, and nothing of value. We are going to be stuck on this island forever, unless we grow flippers!","You forget, we have a rich patron at Troezen, waiting for our return. He will pay our fare, and if we lie? Well then, the captain can seize our cargo, this fine prize cow!"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,You said it was a cow.,It’s a big cow.,"It’s an enormous cow, with horns, and it’s going to be extra.",And where do you think you’re going?,To get the cow safely below decks so we can set sail.,"We’ll not be going anywhere today. There’s all the cargo to load, and we’ll not do that before the evening tide. Don’t worry, we’ll be off first thing in the morning."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"I’m no friend of that King Minos, and I’d like to help a fellow Greek, but business is business and I’m not leaving without my cargo.",Maybe I can help.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Everyone aboard the ship.,"We’re facing the wrong way, you must turn the ship to point at the harbour entrance, then we’ll have a chance with the oars.",You know you won’t be able to get aboard after you’ve pushed us off?
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Are we safe?,Where’s Hercules?,Your friend stayed on the quay to launch the ship. Without him we’d not have got out of the harbour in time. He saved all our lives.,Hercules. Hercules. what should I do now?,You could – cough – start – splutter – by pulling me in!
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Head for the chariot. Tighten that sail, and everyone, from now on – silence.","The Minoan Navy, Poseidon’s chariot, a sea mist with the wind blowing strong and that great white bull. If we live through this then you two have some explaining to do."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"…could be anywhere in here … quiet, we have to listen for them … steady ahead everyone …","I see them, off the starboard bow. We have them, ram them, get alongside."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"That’s us, you fools.","… Glannos, what are you doing on the enemy vessel?"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Hold fast, if you value your life.","That fish is not here for you, it is here for the ambassador of Poseidon, to speed him on his way.","Iolaus, I think you had better explain."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Well, this must be the safest ship that ever sailed. We have Hercules on the crew, and we are carrying out a mission on behalf of Poseidon himself, we should all sleep soundly tonight.","But how does the story end? You have told us only of seven challenges and that leaves, five to go. Do the heroes succeed?"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"The men of Sparta are the fiercest warriors in all of Greece, I think our friend has made a wise choice for his new home. They will worship his strength and his spirit, he will make Poseidon proud.","That’s all well for him, I have a business to run. We had better get to Troezen. Heroes, gods or whatever, I still expect to be paid."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Your majesty, thank you for letting this simple trader have the honour of meeting you in person. I’m pleased that I have been able to serve you by delivering Hercules and Iolaus from certain death at the hand of King Minos.","Although it pains me to raise such a vulgar subject, my crew would not forgive me if I didn’t mention the small matter of the agreed payment.","Of course, let me summon my exchequer, the man who deals with the kingdom’s money, he will arrange your payment. What was the agreed price?",That seems a very steep price for bringing two passengers from Crete.,"Three, sire, there was also a rather large bull. I’ll have no man saying that I don’t strike a fair bargain. This was the amount agreed, and a small recompense for the loss of my livelihood.",Your livelihood?,"Yes, sire, for fifteen years I’ve traded between Crete and Greece. I know nothing else but that route and the merchants I meet at either end. Now I fear that me and my crew will not be welcomed back as long as King Minos rules.","Let me summon the exchequer, and I will have a meal brought, we can discuss your problem while we eat."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"T-t-the king has explained y-y-your problem to me, I h-h-have studied the sea routes around Troezen for s-s-some time now and it seems to be an excellent home port for any trading ship.","As well as Crete, from here a ship can sail east to Rhodes, south to Egypt or west to Syracuse. However, I believe the greatest riches could be gained by opening a new route through the Hellespont. It is well known that spices from India fetch a high price in Greece, and that the city of Troy controls this trade. The spices arrive in Troy by land, brought by Persian traders using teams of camels and donkeys, which they call caravans. What I have found, is that these caravans take a long route, following the southern shores of the Black Sea. A trader who could sail to Colchis, could meet the caravans, weeks before they arrived at Troy, and buy the spices at a bargain price.","That would be a fine plan, if it did not mean certain death. I take it then that you have not heard of King Diomedes, who rules in that part of the world? Then let us sit and pour the wine, and I will tell you a tale so gruesome it will make your hair curl."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Hercules, your eighth challenge is to stop this barbaric practice and to free the Mares of Diomedes.","We’re not heroes, just traders, so we’ll go to trade with these spice merchants, as long as you promise to deal with the man-eating horses.","Deal. now, I have a suggestion for our cargo on the outward voyage …"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"They think it’s a bad omen, a sign that your luck has run out and that this expedition will be a failure.","Luck? What has luck got to do with it? Let me show you how a hero makes his own luck. Iolaus, you take port and I’ll take starboard.",We can’t row all the way to Colchis.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Welcome, my friends, welcome to Chalcedon, you are most fortunate to arrive today. Today we are having one of our biggest celebrations. Today is the day when, according to our history, Dionysus first learnt the secret of how to grow grape vines. It is the fifth or sixth most sacred day in our calendar, not quite as important as when Dionysus first created wine, but much more important than when Dionysus conquered India.","I take it, then, that you are followers of Dionysus.","Of course, we follow the god of wine, but quickly, we must go to the village square. This is our fourth festival this month and I’m afraid we now have only a little wine left, we must get there before it is finished.","You’re short of wine, well there’s a coincidence. We happen to be taking a cargo of … but no, I shouldn’t say as it’s already promised to another buyer.",Do you have a cargo of wine? Has Dionysus himself sent you to us in our very hour of need?,"Well … yes, but, like I say, we only stopped to rest before the next leg of our voyage. Our cargo is promised to a merchant further to the north. It’s a long way to go, but he pays very well for fine Greek wine.","I should explain, that I am the mayor of this village, and you should know that, although we don’t work very hard, we have an extremely good location here for trading, and so we are all very rich. I’m sure we could pay you just as well as this merchant. Besides, this wine will be used to honour Dionysus, someday you may be thankful for the goodwill of the god of wine."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Surely this must be Diomedes, let us be after him, and this challenge can be finished before nightfall.","He who acts in haste, repents at leisure.","Wait, think for a moment. Diomedes is a king, and kings have armies. We have no way of knowing how many soldiers we will face besides the man himself, who seems to be a giant.",Almost a giant.,"Even so. wouldn’t it be better to spend one single day to ensure victory, rather than to risk failure by rushing into unknown dangers?",Very well. what shall we do with this single day?,"Did I say day, I should have said night."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"I don’t like it, going into that palace without my club or bow or cloak. The man means to kill us.","we are rich merchants going to a banquet under the protection of a king. Rich merchants don’t carry weapons, let alone big clubs, and they don’t wear lion skins. Stick to the plan, and we will be victorious.",What happens if his army attacks us before you return?,"Diomedes will not send his army to attack you until he is sure we, your leaders, are dead, if the army comes before we do, then our plan has failed and you should set sail and save yourselves."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Now, I have bored you enough with this tour. Let us go to eat and drink. I would love to hear some stories of your travels.",What’s down here?,"Just the stables, nothing of interest.","Oh, can we look, I do love horses. Do you have any racing horses?","My stables are very ordinary, but I promise that before you leave I will personally take you there. For now, however, we must go and eat while the food is fresh and hot."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Dionysus, it can only be you.","Yes, indeed, you were kind enough to help out my followers, so now I repay the kindness. Such a shame to waste good wine."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"They mean to wait until we are asleep, and then they will come and slit our throats, whatever happens we must stay awake, and then we can surprise them instead.",ZZzzzzz.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"What, what, what!","I was just explaining that if we fall asleep we’re dead, now help me get your bed ready, and then let us prepare our ambush."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Farewell, King Diomedes, I leave you to suffer the same fate as many others have suffered at your hands.","No, please, anything but that. I’ll give you anything, just save me from the horses."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Should I release them?,"No, this place will only remind them of unhappy times. Let’s take them a little further east. We need to go that way anyway to find a caravan."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Perseus!,"If Perseus is here, it can only mean that we already have another challenge, It must be a very dangerous challenge for Zeus to have sent us a hero of such power."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Have your men make that galley ready for departure, we will need to be on our way as soon as possible.","We’re our own men, and no-one else’s, but we’ll go anywhere with Hercules. He’s good for business."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"My daughter is getting married, she will marry a prince from a neighbouring city. He is a good man, and together they will go out and found a new city of their own.",That’s wonderful news. Congratulations!,"Here, in my city, I have been able to protect her, but what can I do when she is so far away. She is still young, and doesn’t see the dangers all around like I do.","I would like you to bring for me Hippolyte’s Girdle. This piece of clothing has magical powers that mean the wearer is immune from all poisons and disease. It will be a wedding gift for my daughter, and it will keep her safe when I no longer can.","Right, consider it done.",It would have been better if the challenge had been closer.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Yes, Zeus means to really test me. He could not have picked a more difficult challenge.",This challenge is from Zeus?,"Zeus told you that I would provide twelve challenges, so if I choose a challenge myself, then in a way, it does come from Zeus.",Then why do you look so nervous?,"I’ve always done the best I could for my subjects, and I’ve never asked one thing for myself … until now.","No, you are mistaken, great king. Even now you do not ask for yourself, but for your daughter."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Jewellery, women love jewellery.","These are not normal women, they are warriors. What need would they have for baubles and trinkets.","Weapons then, and armour.","The Amazons are descended from Ares, the god of war. He blessed them with the skills to make the best weapons in the world - and all our armour is made for men, it would not fit women.",What about wine? Wine worked last time.,"Aye, wine might work. Everyone loves wine.",Something else everyone likes. Salt. They like a bit of salt to give flavour to their food.,"And olive oil, how about that? I’ve heard that the Amazons live so far north that olives don’t grow up there. Imagine that."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Hold your fire, we are traders bringing rare goods from the city of Troezen. We wish to trade for fine Amazonian weapons. We are not here to fight, but we will fight to defend our cargo from pirates.",Well spoken. but do I look like a pirate to you?
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Be aware that you are in the land of the Amazons now. Armed men are killed on sight. Any man unaccompanied by a woman is liable to immediate arrest. If I were you, I’d stay on my boat.",maybe I could come with you?,"It is so rare for a visitor to have the chance to see an Amazon city, I would forever regret missing the opportunity, even though the risk may be great. And, I have great faith in my lady’s protection."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Wine, you say? Maybe I should just have a cup to, ah, ascertain the quality?","Of course! One must always check the goods. Steersman, take this gentleman below and let him choose any amphora his wishes to sample. They are all filled with the best wine Greece has to offer."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"That’s all very well, but the Amazons guard their weaponry jealously. I’m not sure I can persuade them to part with what you ask.","Well, I’m sure a man of your talents can be very persuasive. And if you were successful, maybe a few jugs of this fine wine might find their way into your private cellar."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Tell these men what you just told me.,"I noticed at once that everyone in the city treated Calyope with respect. A few times the other women she met started to say something, but silenced themselves when they saw me. However, in the marketplace, I was walking five paces behind Calyope, as is the custom for Amazon menfolk, when a woman came out of the crowd. She couldn’t see me from where she was standing, but I saw her. She bowed to Calyope and greeted her as ‘my princess’.","That can only mean that Calyope is Hippolyte’s daughter. While we’ve been stuck here, you’ve been off touring the city with their spy. What did you tell her?","We’re here to trade, aren’t we? what do you think the queen would trade for the life of her daughter? Surely that would be worth a girdle.","No! You cannot mean to kidnap a lady for ransom. The dishonour would be unbearable. Besides, she is, an innocent in this.","Well, she didn’t look so innocent when she and her warriors were pointing their bows at our heads. In any case, it seems to me we’ve got ourselves three options. One, a simple kidnap and no-one gets hurt. Two, we storm the city, maybe we all get killed, maybe we win and kill a lot of Amazons – either way, lots of people die. Three, we give up and go home, then we can wait for Alcyoneus to come and do the killing."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Forgive me, but there is a matter of some delicacy you may want to attend to personally. The Barter Master arrived early today, and insisted on verifying the quality of the wine. I’m afraid he was unused to strong drink, and did not think to add any water. He is, therefore, now below decks and quite insensible.","You men need our constant attention, otherwise you find all kinds of ways to destroy yourselves.",Idiot!,"Yes, but a man of stamina. See, he has drunk almost an entire amphora."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Where is Calyope? She had better not be harmed.,"She is in good health. Iolaus, bring the princess, she is to be released."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Follow me, and bring your bow, we must slow the enemy down, and buy some time for the sailors to get the galley moving.",Everyone. close your eyes - and if you value your lives you’ll keep them shut!
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"The archers, who faced us, are turned to stone, but the rowers face away from us. They are unharmed, and the canoes will soon catch us.","Now it’s your turn, Those statues will be heavy, but a well-placed arrow should knock them down."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Once we sell these Amazon weapons.,or us.,—you just have to ask.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"I have been told of your next challenge, you must steal the Cattle of Geryon. It will not be easy. The cattle are guarded by a herdsman who is the son of Ares, god of war. The herdsman has a dog, Orthro, a giant of an animal with two heads and crushing jaws. Geryon himself is a giant with three bodies, three heads and six arms, but even that is not the worst of it, the cattle are pastured on the island of Erytheia, which sits halfway between Africa and Europe at the very mouth of the Mediterranean. It is at the very edge of the known world.","We must go and fetch the captain, and the sailors. I saw some of them departing yesterday, we must fetch them back. I know it’s a long way, but something will come up, it always does. We must try."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Zeus, my father, why do you mock me with this impossible challenge? Lend me your divine aid, at least make the journey possible.","Hera, Ares, Athena, Poseidon. Will any god answer my prayer?"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Lord Hades, forgive me, I had not expected you to answer my call.","I understand, the lord of the dead is not often welcome in the land of the living. I know I can be quite intimidating."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"But today, I have been given special permission by my brother to visit the world of light and to offer you my assistance. I understand that you have a long way to go, and wish to avoid a slow sea voyage?",Come!
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,You have a chariot?,And a charioteer?
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"… always keep this with you, it is easy to get lost in my realm, and this compass will show you the way. Hold it in your hand and whisper to it where you want to go. It will point in the right direction.","As you travel, you must look straight ahead - glance neither to the left nor to the right, and, most importantly of all, you must take nothing from my realm."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Where did you go? How did you know I’d be here?,"Well, when you left the throne room, I decided I had better make haste to prepare for our journey. I was in the marketplace when I saw Hades on the battlements of the palace and then this gateway to the Underworld erupted from the ground. I guessed it had to be something to do with you.",We’d better get going.,But where to?,"To Erytheia, of course. To get there and back quickly, Hades has granted us safe passage through his kingdom. You must remember to look only to the front - not left or right - and we must not take anything from his realm back into the surface world. Got it?","Yes, Hercules. but Hercules, how will we find our way about underground without the sun or moon or stars to guide us?"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Do you remember where you are?,"In the Underworld, the realm of Hades.",Do you remember where to look?,"Only to the front, not to the left and not to the right.",Very well. I’m going to take my hands away. Try to remain calm.,What did you see?,"I saw my grandfather in the wall of the tunnel. He seemed to be in trouble, and was calling for help. I haven’t seen him since I left home four years ago. If his spirit is here, in the Underworld, then he must be dead.","Maybe, but maybe not. There are creatures in the Underworld that seek for the living like flowers seek the sun. Maybe they were trying to draw you away so that you would lose yourself in these tunnels.",Maybe.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"What, what, what’s going on?","Ouch, why … oh yes, only to the front."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Hercules, look down at the ground.",With just a handful of these we could be rich.,"I’ve been rich, believe me, it’s not everything that people say.","But think of the good we could do, think of all the people we could help, we could build a new a bath house in the city, dedicated to you Hercules. You could go there every day.","Think what you are saying, Hades has many ways of tricking good men into doing bad things. If you knew him like I do, you would not talk this way."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,How are we meant to get there?,Africa.,Did you bring any rope?,"Why did you bring so much, did you think we’d have to tie up a Titan … on second thoughts, don’t answer that question. Whatever the reason, we’ll need it now. You should stay here, I’ll be back soon."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,You missed.,"No I didn’t. there’s the boulder, right there right -",- right where I was sitting until a moment earlier.,"Stop, there’s no need, I’m fine … that tickles, It’s a good plan, it just would have been better if you’d have given me some warning. Now, what’s stage two?"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,That’s an impressive contraption. do you think it could get us and the cattle off the island?,"Alas, no, the device works because it is pulled by the earth to the lowest point on the rope, which is at the middle. So you can travel from either end to the middle, but never from the middle to the end. Besides, it wouldn’t be strong enough to carry even one of those cows.","You use lots of words and tell me nothing of use, we might swim off this island, or build a raft, but there is no way to get these cattle back to Troezen. The challenge is lost.",Not at all. have you not thought why we couldn’t travel directly to Erytheia through the Underworld?,"Because it would have been too easy, and Zeus takes pleasure in seeing me suffer?","Possibly, but there’s another reason. The Underworld only allows travel to places that are part of the earth.",There is a gap between the bottom of this island and the main body of the earth. Poseidon’s realm lies between Erytheia and the realm of Hades.,This is a floating island!,"You mean, that we could sail this whole island back to the shore.","Not sail exactly, Pull down on that rope and follow me."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Hercules? scourge of the giants, hero among mortals. Are you now just a common thief come to steal my herd?","I can see you behind there, skulking like a cockroach, your lion skin cloak is unmistakeable."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Pstt.,"Don’t look down, just hold still. I’ll climb up inside your cloak and then you can crawl out along the stream. Geryon only sees the cloak, he doesn’t know who’s inside."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Hold! there was no poison on that arrow, your king still lives. This arrow, however, is poisoned. Come one more step and he will die.",Kill him and we’ll tear you limb from limb.,Why does this monster deserve to live?,"He’s no monster, he’s our king and we love him.","Geryon is a good ruler, wise and just … We have prospered during his reign … He leads us in battle, always in the thick of the fight … He saved my life when we fought the barbarian invaders … and mine … and mine!"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Hercules.,"Father Zeus! the challenge was not to kill Geryon, only to steal his cattle.","Geryon has become proud, he thinks he has control over Mother Earth, and so he no longer feels the need to worship me. He ordered my statue to be torn down and my temple to be used as a storehouse.","He is a good ruler, he protects his subjects and serves them well.","He teaches them to disobey the gods, they must learn that to worship the gods is not only right and good, but also necessary. You must show them that Geryon has taken the wrong path and sets a bad example. Kill him!","This was not the challenge, and I will have no part in it, you gods want only power. I have learnt now what all men know in their hearts, that power is nothing unless it is wielded with honour and justice and mercy.",Very well.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Now, ungrateful son of mine, hear the real reason for my visit.",I’ll hear nothing more from you.,"Well then, if you grieve so over one mortal, imagine how you will feel when Alcyoneus destroys whole cities."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Well, if we can’t take the apples then no-one else shall have them.",Except maybe father.,"Yes, we’d let father have one, but of course he’ll never come to claim it because he has to hold up the sky all the time."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Soon it will be our wedding anniversary, five thousand years to the day, and I would like to give my wife a gift. A golden apple from the very tree I gave her on our wedding day, all those years ago.",And I am to fetch it for you.,"Indeed. Leave your mortal pet here to tend the cattle, and use the shadow compass to travel through the Underworld. Call for me when you have the apple.","Mortal pet? Wait, you mean that Iolaus still lives!",Indeed.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"What do you want, little man?","It seems to me that the best way to support a heavy load would be on your head, then your spine would be straight, and you could stretch more easily. It must give you quite a pain in your neck to be bent like that for five thousand years. You could probably do with a break.","Has Zeus sent you to torment me, little man?","Quite the opposite, in fact I’m here to offer you the chance of a short holiday."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Go on.,All you need to do is to fetch me a golden apple from Hera’s tree and I will grant you a whole hour’s respite from your labour.,And who will hold the sky while I am gone?,I will.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,You? the sky would crush you as flat as a pancake in less than a second.,"I am not some ordinary mortal, to be addressed in such a way by the likes of you, Atlas. My name is Hercules, son of Zeus, and I am the strongest man that has or will ever live. I defeated the giants, I wear the cloak of an invincible lion, I have travelled the Underworld, and I demand your respect.","I will fetch the apple for you, but first you must kill the serpent."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Dear ladies.,"Dear ladies, how difficult it must be for you to see those golden apples every day and never to be able to pick one. wouldn’t it be marvellous if a brave hero could rid you of the vile serpent, Ladon?",No man shall ever enter our garden! except father.,"I will not need to enter your garden, if you will give me your assistance.","Dear ladies, will you give me your assistance, PLEASE?"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Where have you been? what took you so long?,"Never mind that, are you injured? Why do you roar?","Oh that, I didn’t think anyone would hear, the pain is always greater with the cold air of morning. I get terrible cramps in my muscles and roaring makes me feel better."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"Well, for a little man you are quite strong. is that a scratch?","No, no, just a cloud.",It looks like a scratch to me.,Have you got the apple?,"Yes, I do, and I saw Zeus too. He’s not happy that you killed Hera’s serpent. He says he’s gone to find another one, so I’m to take the apple to Olympus on his behalf. You’ll have to hold the sky up a little longer, I’m afraid.",You’re lying.,"How did you know? … I mean, no I’m not.","I know that you’re lying, because I know that the apple is to be a gift from Zeus to Hera to celebrate their wedding anniversary. He would never let another man deliver it to her.","I know that the lie wasn’t your idea, you’re not clever enough to have come up with this alone.","It’s true, everything about me is big except my brain.","So it must have been your daughters who put you up to this deception, if you stop it now and take back the sky, then I promise not to call Zeus to punish you.","Well, that’s just the thing, my daughters have used their magic to cast a spell of silence around these mountains. You can call as loud as you want, Zeus won’t be able to hear you.","And don’t think you’ll be able to move from that spot either, I’ve tried and the sky is much too heavy. So I’m free and you’re stuck in eternal torment. Who’s the dummy now?","Very well, you win. I don’t blame you for wanting to escape. This is a terrible punishment to endure. I hope you enjoy your freedom, just, before you leave me here forever, will you grant me one last request.",Of course.,The sky is rubbing my head terribly. I’m sure it won’t be long before it wears right through the skin. Please would you take the weight off for a few seconds while I make a pad out of my cloak to put on my head?
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,You tricked me.,It’s no crime to trick a trickster.,"You broke your promise, and tried to trick me into carrying the sky forever. Now we are simply back to where we would have been if you had kept your word. All is fair.","I see, I didn’t behave very honourably, and now I’ve got what I deserve.","honour can be quite painful, can’t it."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Don’t you know we’re in a hurry. I don’t even know how long we’ve got left and here you are discussing water works with this old man.,"This old man, is the town astronomer. He can tell the day, and many other things, from the positions of the stars.","Your young friend and I, have calculated that in two days it will be exactly a year since Zeus appeared in your dream.","Then we must be away, time is running out.","Calm yourself, everything is prepared. I see you still have the apple. You should summon Zeus and hand it over. While he is here you should ask about the next challenge. Once you know where we need to go and what we need to do, let’s meet by the entrance to the Underworld.","Very well, you two take the chariot. I will wait here to summon Zeus, beyond the town walls and away from other people.","Father Zeus, come and claim what is yours!"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"You’re not really here, I have only brought your spirit to this place, so that we can talk. A raven will come to collect the golden apple. You should leave it on the ground when you return to your body.","I hope your business with me will be short, I am in quite a hurry.","No time passes while you are here, we can take as long as we like to talk. You are, after all, my son and I should like to know you better. Someday, when your mortal part is dead, I would like you to come and live here with the other gods. See, I have prepared a couch for you."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,And what if I fail the final challenge? what if Alcyoneus returns to make war on the gods.,"It will be a great war. A fight such as the world has not seen for a long age. In the end the gods will prevail, just as we have many times before.",And what about men? they have no defences against Alcyoneus. Will you simply let them be destroyed?,"If that is what must be, then it must be, this is not the first race of men that I will have seen come and go, in fact it is the fifth. The first was the golden race, so wise, talented and healthy as to be almost gods themselves. They were our friends and companions, but they left this earth long long ago, and we know not where they went. The next race was the silver race, they were also worthy and good. They farmed the land, growing grapes, wheat and olives. Some of the silver race still live, the silent heroes hiding amongst the rest. Next came two races of bronze, the second destroyed the first and I destroyed the second. They were disgusting - running around unclothed and eating raw flesh - they did not deserve the earth. Finally we have the current race of men, the race of iron. They started no better than the bronze, but Prometheus took it on himself to teach them some good behaviours, and so they survive still.","Yes, it would be a shame to see them destroyed just when they are beginning to be interesting. Not a disaster, but definitely a shame, so you had better listen carefully as I explain your final challenge.","my brother, Hades, believes himself to be the rightful ruler of the gods. He is the eldest, but he is not the strongest or the wisest, and it is good to remind him of this from time to time. He has a dog, which he dearly loves. You may have heard of it. It is named Cerberus."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,You would like me to kill this dog?,"Not kill, but capture, I would like to have Hades’ favourite pet delivered to me. I shall keep it safe and sound as a constant reminder that Hades rules the Underworld only because I allow it.",Wouldn’t it be easier to …
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"That device is an invention of Striasta, the sand runs slowly out of the bowl and collects underneath. When the bowl is empty we must replace the sand and start again.",What use is this child’s toy to us?,"It takes exactly one day for the bowl to empty twenty times, we can tell how long we have been travelling, and so we will know how long we have left to complete the challenge."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Why are we stopping? We must be close by now.,"What’s the use? The second day is almost at an end. Even if we get the cattle to Troezen, I’ll have no time at all to complete the final challenge, the year will be over.","The year, yes. but how long did Zeus say that you had to complete the twelve challenges?","A year. and a day, I had a year and a day. It can still be done.","Time will still be tight, but maybe I can help with that.","I will take Geryon’s herd to Troezen, and you can go direct to Tartarus. I will find a way to join you as soon as I can."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"This way, Iolaus, this way.","I’m just down here, Iolaus, I’m trapped. Just a few steps and you could save me.",Don’t leave me here. it’s dark and I’m scared.,"Stupid boy, that’s the wrong way, you’ll get lost.","How dare you disobey me, you ungrateful little wretch."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,Were my instructions not clear? did I not say to take nothing from my realm?,"Very well, as you offer no defence, I will pass judgement as I see fit."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"You have taken something from me, so now I will take something from you. Don’t worry, I won’t take anything valuable, just your spirit.","Now, follow me.",And what if I don’t.,You’ll find it quite difficult to stay here without a body.
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"You are to be my servant … at least until I tire of you. Your main duty will be as my cup bearer. It is not a very difficult job and over time I may find more challenging tasks for you, but for the moment it will do.",Put these on so that everyone will know that you are in my service. Do not forget to wear them whenever you are outside the palace or you may be mistaken for a lost soul by my demon guards. I don’t think you’d like to find out what the punishment is for getting lost around here.,"As I am now your servant, I feel it is my duty to tell you that you are going to be robbed.",Your brother Zeus has commanded Hercules to come to Tartarus to steal your dog. They intend to teach you a lesson and prove to everyone that Zeus is the greatest of the gods.,"How dare they! In my own realm I rule completely. I am invincible. I will find Hercules, I will kill him and I shall deliver his body back to Olympus. Then Zeus can lay it on the couch he has prepared for his favourite champion, and everyone will see how he is weak and I am strong.","For someone as powerful as you, that would be a simple thing to achieve, but these people have dared to invade your home. Unless you humiliate him completely and for all time, who is to say that Zeus won’t try this again.",What did you have in mind?,"Zeus intended to steal your dog, you should steal his champion, get Hercules to stay here with you, for all eternity, not as a spirit but as a living being. And make him do it of his own free will. Who will doubt your power when you have taken Zeus’ champion from him?"
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"So, Hercules, you have come to teach me a lesson by stealing my pet.","Yes, that’s right, your dear friend is here with me. The merest suggestion of torture was enough to make him tell me all your plans."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"I could send you running back to Zeus, or I could make you a prisoner here, but whatever people may say about me, I am a sporting man. Maybe you would care to have a wager with me?",Let me hear the terms of this wager. Then I will decide.,"The terms, are simplicity itself. All you have to do is to beat Cerberus in a fair fight, then you may take him to Zeus.",And if I lose?,Then you will stay here in Tartarus and serve me as my champion for ever.,"I accept, Now, you had better unchain your beast. And maybe you should say goodbye at the same time.",Very well.,"If you can just put aside your weapons and your cloak, we can get started.",Wwwhat.,"Did you really think that I wouldn’t spot the trap you laid for me. I chose my words with care when I said it should be a fair fight. Cerberus carries no weapons of iron and he wears no impenetrable armour. He goes into battle naked, and so should Hercules.","It makes no difference to me, I will still prevail. I am Hercules, son of Zeus, and this is just a dog.",It’s the size of a house.,Just a big dog.,"With three heads, even if it only has one neck."

I have something that belongs to Hades, and while I still have it, then my spirit must remain with him. I hope you find a quick way to the surface before Alcyoneus gets free."
580348__the-twelve-labours-of-hercules,"You have done well. In completing the challenges, you have demonstrated the various virtues, and weaknesses, of humanity. You have proved that you are a man, not a god, and that the prophesy is fulfilled. The spikes that anchor Alcyoneus to the rock are secure, and now that the magic is complete, he will never be able to break free.",So what now?,"For my part, I will return to Olympus and I will take Cerberus with me. He will become my guard dog, although I will have to do something about his breath and maybe give him a bath. For you, anything you want. You are a man, maybe an exceptional man, but a man nevertheless. You will remain here and live amongst men, until it is time for you to join me in Olympus. Maybe you could make yourself their emperor. You have shown me that this iron race of men is stronger and more noble than I might have thought, but they will still need someone to show them the way.","Then I shall lead them by my example, not through tyranny or enslavement.","An odd way to do things, but it is your choice. I will go now, and I will not see you again, until you return to Olympus.",Wait. what about Iolaus? Will you not help me rescue him?,"Ah yes, I have my pet and you want yours. He was brave and clever, for a mortal. A shame he had to die, but you never would have succeeded otherwise. Still, I’m surprised that you of all people would ask for my help in this. Don’t men always have to pay their own debts."

There is no ‘my’ in the creation of endlessness.  The all-loving fourth-dimensional puppeteer wiggles your fingers and blinks your eyes.  When this Most Holy Absolute pulls the strings, everything moves.  This all-loving being is the spiritual force that leads us back to our original source in creation.  Our obligation in this lifetime is to cut the strings and become a part of that creation.

I am Israel.,"Oh yes, my boy we have been waiting for you, the master sail maker from Capernaum that is desperately needed here!  Come.  Sit in my humble tent Israel and rest.

We were hoping that you would honor us by staying for dinner tonight.  Maybe you could bring us up to date on what is happening in Capernaum.","Thank you, Simeon, I appreciate your hospitality.","In the morning, Israel, I will introduce you to some of the villagers and local fishermen so you don’t feel like a stranger here.",Thank you for all that you and Sara are doing.  I promise to repay you.,"That’s not necessary, Israel. Well, maybe you could do one thing for me.  Did anything strange happen on the way to Galilee?  Was there anything at all out of the ordinary going on?",No Simeon.  Why are you asking?,Since who appeared?,"I don’t know that much about him Israel but I have seen him in the market place.  The locals say once you meet him you will never be the same again.  He is being described as some kind of magician or prophet.  Some of the high priests in the temple are trying to portray him as a messenger of the Devil.  If anyone has a partnership with the Devil, Israel, its those self-proclaimed holy men locked up in that hole they call the house of God.  If I had my way, Israel, I would tear their Temple down and bury them alive in it.","Simeon, stop with the politics and tearing down temples.  Israel is going to think you are a mad man!","Well, Sara, you know that I am right.",What is his name Simeon?  The one they call the prophet?,"Some call him Panther bar Joseph others called him Jesus of Nazareth.  If you ask me, he is probably just another crazy person too lazy to do an honest days work.  Israel, are you ok?","If you only knew, Simeon.","No, Simeon, I was just talking to myself.",Leave the boy alone Simeon he has had a long trip I am sure he could use some rest.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Where did you just go, Israel?","I was just thinking about what you were just saying, Simeon, about some crazy person too lazy to do an honest day’s work.",There is no lack of laziness here in Galilee.,Israel?,"Yes, Simeon?"
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,I was surprised to hear that coming from Noah.  Noah was not a stargazer.  Noah was the one man I knew had his feet firmly planted on the ground.,"Simeon, your friend, Noah, did he ever think that John the Baptist or Jesus might have some message to give the world?","Absolutely not.  There was never a message.  Whether it was yesterday, today or two thousand years from now, they are nothing but a bunch of no good daydreaming charlatans with nothing better to do with their lives."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,Simeon could you describe him in your own words?  You know.  What is he all about?,"Well, Israel, I remember one day when a crowd of people were gathering around one of the shepherd’s dog that had been bitten by a poisonous viper.","What happened then, Simeon?"
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Even the animals seem to recognize a part of themselves in this Jesus.  If you want to meet him, you can catch him tomorrow walking the shore line at sunrise.","Yes, my boy."

Tomorrow we will visit the thieves in the market place and shed some light on the dilemma they brought upon themselves.","Thieves are those who fill their houses with anger and fear instead of love.

The destruction these wars create can be devastating, lasting for years at the expense of the innocents. Listen, I am not taking sides here."

The young are too busy living to be concerned with death.,"Old man, your interpretation of who you are through the five senses steals your natural perception of yourself.  Your death has nothing to do with who you are.  Mother nature has robbed you by giving you a false identity.  The faces you see in this lifetime are just illusionary Phantoms of the Earth.  Phantoms cannot die because they never existed.","So you are saying I was never born?  Try to tell the tax collectors you were never born, and see what happens!","What I am saying is your body is just a shell protecting a sleeping seed we call the soul waiting to germinate in this unconscious dream we call life.  When this communion between spirit and flesh is consummated, you will become one with this entity we call God.",Are you telling us we are not born with a soul?
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"I know what I am saying is hard for you to digest, old man, but once you understand that this world you perceive as your home never happened, you will also realize there is nothing here to die.","So, you are telling me I was never born."

All the girls think he is so handsome.","Well, Sara, that didn’t occur to me, but now that you mention it, he is a good looking man.","I sometimes don’t know why, Israel, but I seem to understand his every word.","Oh, by the way, Israel, some of the villagers are going down to the Jordan tomorrow.  John the Baptist will be there, baptizing and teaching the word.  Would you like to join us Israel?","I would not miss seeing John for anything, Sara."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,There will be less hunger and disease in the world. Most of us will be healing not stealing from each other!,"The pure essence of the earth will rise up and give birth.  All will feel this spiritual birth and take flight.  The only war in the world will be the destruction of war.  The hearts of humanity will recognize the enemy is not there or here.  The real enemy is the guilt we carry in our hearts from birth, inflicting our unconscious pain on every bleeding heart by avoiding our own needed heart surgery.  Everyone listen.  I am John the Baptist, and I did not come here just to teach the word today.  I want you all to become mirrors for each other.

The shadows in this scenario are the walking dead we meet in life.  A body without a spirit is the tomb of Lazarus.  Jesus did not raise Lazarus from the dead he raised the God spirit from within.

I was told a good friend of his was shot.,Who?,You know that young man that comes to visit from Ohio?,"Oh no, not Jim Wax?",Yes that is him.,Is he alright?,I heard he is alive but in critical condition.,What happened?,We’re not sure.  I heard some rumors that Jim was trying to help someone who was in a fight.  He was shot in the process.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Sandy, if you ever really want to live in the moment, go out and get yourself shot.",What was that like?,I felt as helpless as a one legged blind man in an ass kicking contest.  All I remember is lying on my back trying to stop my soul from leaving my physical body.  The vibrations were incredible.  It felt like every cell in my body wanted to take flight pulling the life force in difference directions.,What were you thinking?,"There was a part of me that wanted to experience every second of what was happening, but at the same time, I really didn’t want to leave this world just yet.  I was hoping someone was on the phone calling an ambulance, but all I was hearing in the background were people yelling and screaming.  “Someone get help!",How are you doing now?,"Thanks for asking. I am all right.  I was shot in the part of my body that was negative anyway.

291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,Oh come on Chiou.  I see you as you are,"What if I told you my body was just a mental picture my soul was projecting at this moment in time?  That you and I are just thoughts of each other, trying to make something real out of something that never existed, mental images of non-existing life forms using the flesh to make God visible in human forms.  I know you know these things, Sandy.","You are right Chiou, it does sound so familiar to me.","Because of the curiosity you acquired as a child, you were given the ability to ask the right questions.  In return, you were always given the right answers."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,Are you saying there is no point in people practicing meditation?,"No, my son, absolutely not.  What I am saying is that the ‘now’ they describe in meditation is the last door you open before meeting your God.  If you practice meditation through out your daily rituals, the possibility of opening this door and experiencing absolute emptiness is inevitable.  When this actually happens you can enter in and out of this illusion we call time.  My definition of the last door opened through meditation would be ‘Light traveling.’  Remember, Sandman, our perceptions can be blindfolded by the way things appear to the five senses, and that is why taking time out from the drudgery conditions of life to meditate is so important."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,No one will help!  No one will help!,"Calm down, Chiou.  What’s going on?"
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,What are you talking about?,"Sandy, the window washers knocked this bird’s nest off the top of that ledge yesterday, and I found it on the sidewalk.","Chiou, where are the birds?  Are the okay? Where are the birds and their nest?",They are right here in the cardboard box.  I stayed with them all night.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Chiou, there’s the mother hawk up on the ledge.  Everything is going to be all right.","Well, what are we going to do now?"

I will take care of it personally.",What the hell did you say to him?,I told him the truth.,You did what? You mean we are not going to jail?,"No jail today Sandman.  No, he knew about the hawks He said they have been nesting there for years, having their babies for generations.  They reminded him of his childhood when growing up in the country.  He always felt it was a good Omen that the hawks picked his building to nest on."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,This whole spiritual process starts with this sleeping seed we call the Astral body.  We all were given this seed at birth.  You have heard of astral projection?,"Sure Chiou.  Do you know the difference between Light traveling and astral projection? I have done both many times, but if you can elaborate, a little I would appreciate, Chiou.  Sometimes I need a wakeup call."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Imagine if everyone you met in life were just thoughts projected on a movie screen.  If you were director and producer of your own script, how long would it take you to find an escape route from this insanity?","Are we really who we think we are, or just bodies labeled with names by the outside world?","Sandman, you have to understand that humanity is stuck in this circle of death they call home without the slightest notion of how to escape.  Humanity’s biggest problem is:  they cannot see beyond the tip of their noses.  Believe me, my boy, there are other worlds we can walk in and out of reflecting back the answers of who we are.","Chiou, are you saying we are not the only intelligent species in the universe?","Sandman, there are harmonious beings in all shapes and forms living on every planet and star in our solar system and far beyond.  They exist according to the vibrations of their planet.  These vibrations keep them invisible from each other.","Do they ever visit us on Earth, Chiou?","Yes.  But even when they do, we would be invisible to them as they would be to us.  Sandy, their existence also has to do with them finding their place in God’s universe.  Let’s not lose our conversations to terrestrial beings tonight.  We can talk about terrestrial being another time.  I would rather come back down to earth and talk about the challenges we face here, Sandman.","Ok, Chiou, fair enough.  Why do we always hurt the ones we love?","Good question, Sandman.  If we really loved each other, we would be sharing Heaven on Earth.  When the existence of this entity we call the soul has been completed in two humans simultaneously, this energy can merge and take flight as one being.","What are you saying Chiou, that a man’s soul energy can merge with a woman’s soul energy and they can spend eternity together?","Yes, my boy.  This is when two become one. There is no greater celebration in Heaven than the marriage of two souls in the presence of God.",What happens if one of these people dies before the other one does?,"Nothing, Sandman.  Once these souls have merged while both are alive, they are spirit forever.  The phantom body that was used to consummate this heavenly event is left behind to live out its existence until death.  Again, Sandman, when two become one, the body left behind is just a shell.  Hey, don’t look so sad.  Empty shells are only empty because they did their job.  The whole purpose in being on this on this earth is to experience spiritual evolution through oneness.","Chiou, what happens to those bodies that don’t create a soul in their lifetime?"
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,Where are we Chiou?,"We have just left the world of man’s unconscious dream state, and entered into the realm of the soul, Sandman."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"What’s going on, Chiou?",Wind chime is not feeling well; his soul was trying to leave his body last night.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Hi Sandy, what did you bring me today?","I found him on I-64, and I think he may have been hit.  Could you please look at him?","What a wonderful thing you have done, finding this dog and bringing him here.",Sandy didn’t find this dog.  This dog found Sandy.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,Where are you coming from?,Nowhere.  I have always been here.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,What’s with the cross?,I am the carrier of the crucified child.,You mean ‘JESUS’?,"No.  I mean all the innocent children of the world, the children who are dying of hunger and disease, unclaimed children thrown on the garbage dump of humanity, the child who is abused and left to go through life with a broken Spirit, and the potential of finding their place in this world is lost forever.  The future generation of misfits taught from birth to war on each other in the false name of patriotism.  The day the power of Love is consumed by the power of hate this world, as we all know it will end in disaster.  Humanity is at the stage of opportunity to either consciously raise, our Spiritual being one more step towards the evolution of completeness or to destroy the very essence of our world and spirit."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,OM,What can I do to ease your mind my friend?,Where do you go when you die?,The same place you go when you’re born.,What do you mean?,"What I mean is you can’t die unless you were born to begin with.  This whole world thing is something we made up in a dream while God was sleeping if you will.  Death needs the illusion for man to thinks he is real so it can survive and hide in the unconscious mind.  Remember one thing:  if humanity isn’t real, then death isn’t real.  Death is just a trick we play on ourselves to hide from the love of God.  One day in the future while working on your spiritual journey you will realize your whole existence is made of the same material the universe is made of.  At that moment, you will know dying is impossible.  There is really no place to go when you are already there.",Now I know why you came from nowhere. You were always here.,You are a good student my newfound friend.  Thank you for your understanding.  It gives me great hope in humanity.,Words were invented to confuse the soul.,That’s so true.  Your grandma was definitely right.  Words do have their limitations.,It was a pleasure being with you.,I hope we meet again.,Yes we will Sandy.  May your journey back home be as sweet and gentle as the floating wings of the butterfly?
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Sit down my young friend, I could use the company today.",My pleasure Sir.,You can call me Joe.,Okay Joe.  What brings you to Charlottesville?,"Well I just came into town, riding the Greyhound line on my way to Charleston, South Carolina.  When we were told, the bus was having mechanical problems and there would be a two-hour delay before the problem would be solved.  While I was sitting at the bus terminal waiting for the next bus to arrive, a strange thing happened.  I saw my wife of fifty years who recently died standing on the sidewalk in front of the bus station.",Do you know why she appeared to you today?,"Well yes.  For some reason she was pointing towards the sidewalk at something.  When I got closer, I recognized it immediately.  It was the cross I gave Rosa many years ago before going off to war.  As I bent over to pick it up, it disappeared.  I heard Rosa say ‘It’s time to come home, Joe.’  Remember Joe this cross-brought us together in life it will never separate us in death Rosa exclaimed.  I miss her so much, especially today.  It would have been our fifty-second anniversary.",I’m sorry Joe.  When a loved-one dies there’s no place to go except in that gift of love you shared together.  Remember Joe.  Death is the souls gift to life freeing us from this illusion that never happened.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Hey, is everything all right?",Why are you asking?,"Well, you look as if you just seen a Ghost.","No, I’m alright.  I think someone just needed my help crossing over to the other side.  The old guy I just met didn’t realize he was dead yet.  It took a lot of energy out of me.",You’re weird Sandy.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,You don’t know anything the little girl said.  “I see them all the time.,"No there isn’t any magic in the world! No Wizards, elves, fairies, Leprechauns or any other stupid make believe freaks. Get real you little jerk"
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,Use your own mind.,Lily. Magic happens here.,Magic Isn’t Somewhere Magic Is You!,"Lily, come on where going to be late."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Hi, my name is Cheyenne.  Thanks for the lift.  My van is in the shop getting some engine work done.",Have we met before like maybe in another lifetime?,maybe.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Hey there, could you please help me.","Yea, I’m sorry. Forgive me, my mind was somewhere else.","Yes, I know.",Where are you headed?,Down to the city to sell my merchandise to some of the boutiques in Manhattan.,What are you selling?,"Well, I have home made candles, jewelry, some baskets, and different scented soaps.  If I had my van on the road, I would probably have another ten items.  The local artisans in this area and from the Adirondacks made them.  The shops in the city pay more than the shops out here in the country.  Plus, my real income comes from reading Astrology charts and tarot cards.  I do three to four readings a day down in the city for extra money whenever I can."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,What are you doing in Warwick?,"Yes, I remember when they moved into this area a few years ago.  The whole town was in an uproar.  There was talk of some kind of occultism, even some Devil worshiping.  I really had to laugh at that.  Most of the group members I met, either in the town bookstore or out in the countryside, were very loving, compassionate, natural-born seekers of truth.  They would do anything for anybody.  Eventually this group became an asset to the people of Warwick.","Take care, my sweet brother, I will see you again in the near future."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Well, I’m not sure, young man. Wait right there, don’t move.  I’ll be right back.  Let me ask the others in the back room if Jesus is for sale.",There he is!,Yes. We will sell you the painting.  You are definitely the one.,I am?,"When Simon gave us the picture to hold, he said the day would come when the right person will enter this store, and bring Jesus down.  We all decided today was the day.",Do you know Simon?’  They all just looked at each other shrugging their shoulders. “We were never sure ourselves who Simon was.  He would appear and disappear on different occasions. He wandered in here one day and gave us some clothing that needed a little cleaning and this picture of Jesus.,What did he say to you?,"Nothing, except ‘find the right one to sell the picture to.’  I know one thing, young man, if you ever run into Simon you will never forget him.", Why is that?,"Well, he is about six feet six inches tall, and as black as the midnight sky, with eyes that will melt your heart.  He usually wears a maroon poncho-like robe, with a plain rope tied around his waist.  You’ll sometimes see him pulling or pushing a cart filled with aluminum cans.  One of our frequent customers said they saw Simon on Woodhaven Boulevard last week."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,You’re late.,No I’m not late.  You’re just early.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Sandy, most people would see a dead mouse.  I see God.","What do you mean, Simon?  Please explain.","I have always seen all creatures, plants, animals, and humans not as physical bodies, but as spiritual energy.  It is the only way God can distribute Heaven’s healing power in this illusion we call life.  By storing, and disguising this healing energy in different physical bodies. This God force at any time can heal or even resurrect the soul from the dead body it is captured in."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Daddy, can I feed one?","No, sweetheart, they’re not real.","Yes, they are!","That happens to be Sally. Don’t let her squawking fool you, she loves to be held and cuddled."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Oh that’s just Noah.  He appears every fall selling his crafts.  The same people come back every year, buying the same animal statues over again.",How come?,"If I told you why they came back, you would probably never talk to me again.",Try me.,"Well, mainly because the carvings seem to disappear.  One child that comes for lunch frequently with his mom and dad told me his carved bird flew out the window.  His parents looked embarrassed by his answer, so I didn’t feel comfortable in pursuing it.  Another little girl was playing with her carved dolphin on the beach when she said it jumped out of her hands into the water.",These stories go on forever.,"Wait a minute, what are you trying to say?  These carvings come alive and take off on their own?  Come on, give me a break.",I am sorry.  I know how crazy that must sound to you.,I’ve been hearing these stories for years.,"Son, I will be through here in a half hour or so.  Could you wait around and help me pack up?","Sure, oh, by the way my name is Sandy.","My name is Noah.  The last time we met, you were in Galilee playing the part of a sail maker named Israel.","Yes, that’s right.  Then you must be the Noah who worked with Jesus in Joseph’s carpentry shop.",Thank you for finding me Sandy.  We definitely have our work as light travelers cut out for us.,I see you have been talking to the bar maid in Skipper’s.  My time spent with Jesus gave me the opportunity to see my carvings as my children waiting to be born. What is real is real.  What is not real is not real.  You can choose to believe or not believe.  These children’s innocence can make anything happen.,You don’t have to do that.,"Its my pleasure, Sandy.  Anyway, if Nelly decides to fly away, you can always come back for Melody."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,Who is this old chick?,"I am not old, and I am not a chick you idiot.  My name is Nora and we crossed paths before in Jerusalem.  I am in this world for two reasons: to feed the poor, and to light travel."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Young man, step over onto this side of the cross, so we both can say we crossed paths in this lifetime.","Next time we meet, she continued, “it will be in the Bronx.","I see you met Nora. She is a character, that is for sure.","I have watched her bring the homeless people in these areas loaves of bread and fish for months now.  It always seem she has an endless supply.  One week she is here, then like a ghost disappears for a months.  Go figure that.",Where does she live?,"I’m not sure, but one of my regulars heard she lives in Manhattan.",Isn’t that a little expensive for a bag lady?,"I guess anything can happen in God’s world of miracles. Yea, I guess so."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Yes, Sandy.","Amber, my meeting with Jesus was definitely weighed on a universal scale.  I have spent many years light traveling to different places in this world.  My involvement with dozens of extraordinary men and women could never come close to what I felt in the presence of Jesus.  Even during his crucifixion, a rainbow of angels was encircling his body that day at the base of Golgotha.  Something Holy and unprecedented happened that day, and still lingers over the atmosphere of Jerusalem.  God, the creator, still walks in the footsteps of all who visits the Wailing Wall.","I met Jesus on many occasions, Sandy, while visiting my uncle Mordecai, one of Galilee’s most respected Rabbis.  At times Jesus would genuflect in your presence as if the universe revolved around you.  He knew what you were thinking and had the answers to sooth your mind.  Describing his humor would be almost impossible.  He laughed at questions we made so important to our egos but out of respect, he still answered them anyway.  He could make you feel like the sun was shining on a rainy day.  Whenever you ate food that Jesus had blessed, you would instantly experience the Holy Communion of God and spirit.  Thank you Sandy for bringing your Jesus here to me.  The gratitude I am feeling inside at this moment is indescribable.  I will always remember the day you helped me to my feet after I wiped the face of the Holy One.","I will appear as a Whirling Dervish, singing a prayer of Om for the world to hear, Sandy."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,It’s a bad omen!,"No, it’s some kind of evil voodoo Spirit.",What’s going on?
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,I was just thinking about you.,You maybe need this later.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"No, mon, definitely no more treasure hunts.  This lifetime I go hunting for spiritual treasures.  I want to sail on the Sea of Galilee again with the Master sailor, becoming the fisherman and sail maker I was born to be.","I see, you want to be a fisher of men.","Yes, Mon.","I’m Sandy. Maybe, maybe not.",I’m Israel.,"Maybe, maybe not."
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,How long will you be docked here?,"Just for the weekend.  Then I sail back Monday.  I have some errands in Manhattan to take care of.  Also, a visit to my Grandmother’s tomorrow that is well overdue.  She is a hundred years old, give or take a few years.",Where does she live?,"My Grandfather bought her an apartment building in Brooklyn.  She lives on the third floor.  He had a custom elevator built for her to give her easy access.  There is also a live in nurse, Rose Marie, that takes care of her medical and personal needs.","Hey, Israel, would you like a ride into the city tomorrow?","Sure, Mon, I would forever be grateful.","Hey, a ride into Manhattan this weekend is just what I need.","Okay, Sandy, on one condition: only if you let me buy breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Plus, fill up your gas tank.",That’s a deal.
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Even though you have inherited a long lifeline, you were also given the gift of ascension, the ability to leave the earth plain any time you want.  You may not know this, Sandy, but your life had already been planned out before you were born.  The higher forces needed an empty vessel to accomplish the tasks that lie ahead.  The fear, guilt, and judging you were taught as a child never once entered your heart.  You are a clean slate waiting for the spiritual message to be written.  I know your relationships with women could have used a little more understanding on your part; let us just blame that part of your life on your Venus in Scorpio.",Who is this woman who knows everything about me?,"Sandy, I am Cheyenne, Nora, Amber, Noah, Simon, and yes even you Sandy all evolving through each other by being each other.  We have been blessed in the Holy flames of Baptism, fusing our souls together as one spiritual Ark.","Forgive my ignorance, Josephine, but I don’t understand a word you’re saying.","Your knowing now does not really matter Sandy.  Your child like innocence towards all life forms has created a light of compassion in this world of darkness.  Your spiritual door has always been open for anyone to enter.  It is no coincidence that these highly evolved souls, or Light Travelers as you call them, find themselves drawn to your doorstep.  “They are part of God’s spiritual revolution that is now descending upon the Earth.  Your message to them from Jesus will create the light energy necessary to build your Spiritual Ark.  The creation of this Ark by these Light Travelers’ combined energy will give refuge, and save these lost souls from the great flood of the universe. “All these beings you met in Galilee, right up to the present, are part of God’s Spiritual revolution that is now descending upon this Earth.","Hey, Mon, isn’t my grandmother cool?"
291700__the-simplicity-of-innocence,"Hi, I am Sandy.","How’s by youts, my friend I’m Morty O’Brien.",How did an Irish kid get a Jewish first name like Morty.,"That’s easy.  My Irish father fell in love, and married a beautiful Jewish girl.  When I came into this world, both sides of my family decided to compromise by naming me Morty O’Brien.","A Catholic Jew.  I like that, Morty.  I have been watching the way you shoot the hoops.  You must play basketball a lot.","Yea, Morty, I would want you on my team to.","If you don’t play much, then what’s your secret to never missing?","Actually, Sandy, no one has ever asked me that before.  They just assume I am good.  Would you like to know how it work’s?","Sure, Morty.",Do you see those two flies on that fence post over there?,No.,"Well, I can.",How could you see those little guys from where we were standing?,"Easy.  I can project my second being at any time, and in any direction.  The Ancients called it the mental body or the actual body of God.","What are you exactly saying, Morty?","I can leave and re-enter my physical body at any time without anyone knowing.  I have been practicing this my entire life.  When I am shooting the ball, I can actually project my second being body, bringing my vision closer to the hoop.  When Jesus and his disciples were caught on the Sea of Galilee in a raging storm, Jesus used his second being body to walk on water.  “He perfected this spiritual body to such a high degree of intensity, that his disciples actually thought his human form walking on water.  This was the same body he used to ascend back into the heart of the all loving creator.","Morty, are you trying to say you can walk on water?","No, not physically.  I, Morty, cannot walk on water, but my mental body can.  Sandy, the first day you were here watching me shoot, I recognized you immediately.",What do you mean?,"I am Mordecai the Rabbi you met in Jerusalem when you were the sail maker Israel.  In this lifetime, you came into world to bear witness that the love of God still exists for all those who want to find their way back home.  The whole purpose of us light travelers meeting is to lift these Souls out of this monumental tragedy that is about to occur.",What tragedy Morty?,"A monumental catastrophe is about to occur taking the lives of thousands of people and the animal kingdom.  The lost ark of resurrection must be completed before this rapture occurs.  We will only have minutes to levitate souls through the Ark’s portal.  Any soul that has not been transported in the time allotted will just dissipate.  Stardust doesn’t last long in the realm of time. There will be two arks built.  One will hover over Istanbul, and the other over the entire east coast of the United States.  Our task as Light Travelers is to generate and transfer enough spiritual energy to help transport these levitated souls into the Ark."

It’s supposed to be off this one.,There isn’t any street off this one and I really can’t think of a Cole street in the area.

I do an online shopping thin, just started that off.","Well Keira, I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news but that address does not exist.",How can you be so certain?,"Because, like I said earlier, this is the only Mustapha Street in this area and there are no other streets going off it. It just goes straight down and joins Aleko drive at the other end and that’s it!"

Na wa for una o!,"Once we realized what had happened, we all had a good laugh over it and just ordered some ice cream. Eventually we left. But I’m sure something is in the works for later this week though.","Hmph! This time, no shenanigans o! Just tell me when and where to show up! Imagine!

Which one be this nah? ’But’ ke? There is no ‘but’ o! Is this because I missed the shower?,Of course it has nothing to do with your missing the shower.

Can you imagine? Dominic asked me?!,"And if it had been up to you, you guys probably wouldn’t even be dating by now. Never have I seen two people who like each other as much as you two do and be such slow molasses about it.","Ehn, thank you o! Thank you!",So? Have you told your parents? What did your mum have to say about it?,I haven’t exactly told them.,Haven’t even mentioned it at all is more like it.,Don’t look at me! I never said I have a problem with it!,"One could argue that you’re biased. After all, it would be me marrying into your tribe.",As if!

Let’s hope so.,Baby what’s wrong? You seem a bit distracted. Is…are you okay?,It’s nothing really. Just a bunch of things running around in my head.,"Wweelll, I’m your wife. Tell me about it. A burden shared and all that.",Don’t bother your pretty head about it.,Jude? My pretty head runs a business. I’m sure it can withstand the torment of you unburdening to me.,"It’s just…things. It’s not all work related. There are, you know, issues.",What happened? Did you have a tiff with your mum again?,Why would you not just tell her that we have decided to wait a few years before starting a family? What would she do? Monitor how we have sex or what?,Keira there’s no need for us to tell her that. She needs to know that we are two adults and we can make these decisions for ourselves. She needs to butt out of it.,Ehn! I haven’t said that we are not adult nna m’. I’m just wondering if we are handling this well enough. It’s causing unnecessary friction don’t you think?,"Keira, allow me handle this, please.",Okay.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,What would you like to eat?,What would you like to eat?,What’s there to eat in this house?,There’s soup. And I think there’s a little stew from dinner yesterday. We could do either of them?,Hm! Don’t feel like any of that. What else?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Maybe jollof rice with that tomato and beef sauce thing you do so well.,I’m not sure I have everything to make it.,Mama Risi would still be open. You can pick a few things from her and we should be good.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Let me go sort that out now. I’ll be back soon.,Please help me get another pack of juice or make that two. I’ll give you back the money when you get back. My wallet is in the bedroom.,Don’t bother! I’ll just get it though.,She’s a married woman Majid!,"I know! She…alright. I know she’s married right. But she’s so…not exactly unhappy, just wound up. It can’t be good for her. And that husband of hers! No offense. I mean the guy is brilliant and all that but we both know that doesn’t mean he knows what to do with his wife.","And you know it better than him? If you weren’t my friend, I’d give you the trouncing you deserve right now.",I haven’t done anything.,But I know you! You have a bee in your bonnet over this lady.,"Even if this guy is having issues with his wife, marriage is an intricate thing between a man and his wife. Leave them be to work things out for themselves. In fact, focus on finding a wife for yourself instead!",What’s this? Do you think it is for lack of candidates that I haven’t gotten married?,More like an oversupply of candidates!,Why are we arguing about this?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Did you guys…have a fling or something?,A fling?,"Yes, a fling. Why are you acting offended? Can you remember how many ‘flings’ you’ve had?",I wouldn’t have had a fling with her. She isn’t that sort of girl.,Old habits die hard Mahj.,Do you believe in fate?,You. Are. Kidding. Me.,Mahj snap out of it! It is not even amusing. Come on!,"Maybe, maybe if I hadn’t lost her card and had been in touch with her then, maybe she would have reviewed her options.",Mahj are you listening to yourself? Maybe…maybe… Mahj she is married. Period. No time for these maybes. Have you even wondered that maybe Fate was saving you from disaster?,She’s not happy with him.,"You are looking for an excuse. Usually, I admire you compulsive obsessive streak. It does get things done with amazing thoroughness but this here is the downside. You never know when to pull back! Mahj trust me, this needs pulling back.",When did you do a specialization in psychiatry?,You are going to do this aren’t you?,Just to be sure she’s okay.,Will it help if I said she’s okay?,I guess we are going to do this.,We?,We.,You say it was delivered by hand?,Yes ma. Just before you entered. You might have seen him on your way in.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Dear have you got a minute?,Ah…okay shoot.,Thanks. I got the invitation card. How did you manage that?,Manage what?,The invitation to the Forum. I just got it here at my shop.,Jude?,"Keira, you say an invite was sent to you?",Yes. It didn’t come from your office?,No. I just asked Eni and he says your business was not on our list of invitees.,Oh. So…who else would send me one?,Well. Perhaps your business is more popular than you think it is.,I didn’t think it was popularity that earned you an invite. I thought I heard it said that there was a minimum balance sheet figure.,"Except you have a sponsor, a benefactor which apparently you have?",I have no idea who could have sent me this. I actually thought it was you.,Nope. Not me.,"That’s surprising. I can’t think of anyone. Alright, a customer just walked in. Let me call you back."
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,"Babe, are you still at the office?",Why? Is anything the matter?,Eni called asking for you. He says you were not picking his call. He sounded somewhat confused when I told him you were at work.,Just said to give you a heads up.,Thanks.,I’m about to get dressed. I wish you had been able to come.,"Well, I wasn’t invited.",But Jude…,"It was you invited not me. Anyway, I’ve got to go. Have fun."
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,A pretty head like yours shouldn’t wear such a frown. You’ll give yourself wrinkles.,So it was you who sent the invite.,"If you mean the one to this event, Then yes! I sent it. Were you excited to receive it?","Mr. Majid, I don’t…","Majid, just Majid. I thought we had become acquainted enough for us to drop the appellations.","Mr….Majid. Majid, what are you doing?",Giving a friend a leg up.,A leg up?,"Majid, I really appreciate that but…",But what Keira? Of course I know your name. You told me remember? On that first afternoon.,"Majid, what are you about?",I’m just helping out a friend. This is a great place to network. Think corporate gifts for any one of these names. Think opportunities to expand your service base. Think…,Majid? I appreciate it. Really I do but that’s not what I asked and you know it.,Did you come on your own?,Did you expect someone to come with me?,I imagined your husband might show up with you.,Really?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Funke. Please lock up the shop today. I need to step out for an appointment and I am not sure I’ll be back before we close.,Yes ma.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Hello?,Hello.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Are you on your way out?,Yes. How did you know?,I can hear street sounds.,Oh. Was there something you wanted?,Not really. I…never mind. How’s your day going?,It’s fine.,Alright. I’m about to go see a prospective client. Wish me well.,Best wishes Jude. Go get them.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Nne what’s the matter? You’re late again today.,Good evening Jude. I didn’t mean to be late again. Time just got away from me.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Are you okay Jude?,I don’t understand.,Jude. What’s happening to us? We’ve never fought like this in all the years that we’ve known each other.,Perhaps we are both stressed from work.,Do we need to take some time off work?,I can’t get off from work right now. There’s just so much going on right now.,"I’m not asking for today or tomorrow. Just…perhaps when this wave of prospects and things slow a bit, maybe we should just take some time away. Just be by ourselves. We’ve both had a crazy year.",We should do that.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Say that again?,Keira. Keira look at me!
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Keira ogini? You’ve been miserable for a few months now. Don’t think because we’ve not said anything to you we haven’t noticed o!,I’m not miserable! I just have a lot of things on my mind.,"What things? What do you mean ‘think’, ‘might’, cheating?",There’s this man… I’m not sleeping with him o!,So what exactly is going on?,Nothing. He’s helping me out with some business things. You know that I’m trying to expand and there are a lot of things that I had not realized about business and services…,Keira! Kay! What is going on? Why are you feeling…are you projecting some sort of gratitude gone wrong or something?,Do you think that is what it is?,"I think you need to cut off from this person. No matter how helpful he’s being to you, it’s not healthy for your relationship with your husband! Girl! Seriously!","Clara, he has contacts that I would never have known how to aspire to! It’s not as if I’m not aware…of the undercurrents but he’s never come right out and said it or anything that…would be really inappropriate. I think I can put him in his place if need be.",I think you are playing with fire.,Is that all you’re going to say to me?,"Is there something more you need me to say to you? If you can’t see beyond your nose for all the ‘wondrous’ things this guy is doing for you, then what more do you want me to say? Does Jude even know about this person?",Kind of. They’ve had dealings before.,"So, you met him through Jude? Are they friends?","No. Look, maybe I phrased it wrongly. We are not having an affair so…let’s just not let it spoil lunch.",I hope you really know what you’re doing. I pray you…don’t destroy your life. Do you still love your husband?,I’ll be praying for you but I want no part of this.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,How’s she doing? What are the doctors saying?,"Majid, she’s alive and she’s in good hands. I think we should leave."
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,What are the doctors saying?,She’ll wake up whenever she will but she’s stable.,I hope she gets better soon.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,"Man, are you crazy?! I was just about to go see the doctor. What’s your problem?",You know what? That is it!! This absurd game has finally gone on too long!!,"Do you realize what you’ve done? That was the lady’s husband in there and you barged in and put on such a show for him!! On top of his worry over his wife, you’ve probably left him wondering about the status of your relationship with her!! Are you okay?!!!"
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Good morning….,Funke. Good morning Sir.,You guys are opening a bit late today.,I had to go by the hospital.,I hope you’re okay?,Madam had an accident. She is at the General Hospital and they wouldn’t let us see her!,An accident you say?!,Yes. Yesterday on her way back to the shop. She has been unconscious and Oga says that she was badly injured.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,"You know what? Get into your car, can you drive? Go home. Go sleep it off. You look terrible. I will come see when I get off later. I’m still on call till early afternoon.",Will you let me know how she’s doing?,They said she just crossed over to the other lane right in front of the oncoming jeep.,"We thank God that it was not worse than this. Thank God. But this is a wakeup call! She must have fallen asleep on the steering on something. You both work too hard. What are you pushing yourselves so hard for? Some things will have to change once she’s back from the hospital. I just pray that there will be no permanent damage to her. Nna, it is well. Chineke no n’olu."
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,It’s not as obvious as all that Kei. And the doctor says it would fade a bit with time. Indeed IT IS already fading out.,Keira! It is okay!,Have you eaten at all?,I’m not hungry.,Well you have to eat! You’ve already lost enough weight during your stay at the hospital. You cannot come and loose the remaining one now!
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Keira!,You are worrying me!,Are you okay? I mean apart from the physical aspect. Clara…said some things to me that are a bit confusing. I decided not to bring it up before but…,Why hasn’t Clara been to see me?,She did come. But you were so out of it most times then that I’m not certain it registered. You know she had to travel shortly afterwards for her delivery.,She could call me though.,Perhaps she’s worried that you wouldn’t pick her calls.,Why would she think that?,"She feels guilty. For some reason she thinks she was the cause of the accident, that you would hold her responsible.",Oh no! Why would she think that? It was my fault. I wasn’t paying attention.,Perhaps we can call her? I know she’ll be so glad to hear from you.,"Yes. Yes, let’s call her.",What was it that Clara meant by what she said?,What exactly did she say?,"That you were having an affair, an emotional affair she called it. And she went on and on about a lot of things that I couldn’t make heads or tails of but the summary was that you were having inappropriate feelings for someone.","He’s never called even. Majid, that’s his name, he’s never called in all of this.",Are you in love with him?,"I don’t know. I’m not sure. I’m angry at him but at the same time I miss him. Jude… is barely even speaking to me. Oh, he’s not being negligent or anything like that. It’s just that…I feel that he’s not here! He’s here with me in body but absent…in his mind?","So do you think if this Majid called, it would make you feel better?",I don’t know! Did I ever say thank you for holding things down for me at the shop?,It’s actually Funke you should thank. I just look in once in awhile. That girl has held everything down like a pro! You should see some of the ideas she has introduced. You really should think about promoting her or something.,She’s already my head shop girl.,"Perhaps you should make her a manager then. Yes! You have to encourage the girl! She wowed me with the way she handled everything, has been handling everything! Even your mum can’t sing enough of her praises. And besides, the business IS expanding. I had not realized how much until all of this. You’ll need a manager, even if it weren’t because of your recuperation, you’d still need a manger.",I guess I’ll have to look into that. God bless her.,Amen.,What are we eating?,"Porridge yam. With smoked fish, ponmo and other mede-mede.",Abeg when will it be ready so that we can eat?,Soon. We can call Clara now though and do her longer-throat. I’m sure she’s fed up with awon burger ati fries and all those American things.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,She’s sinking into depression.,She’ll disappear from there and reappear here immediately! Clara and orisi risi food.,"Keira. We all love you. All of us, Jude, Clara, me, your parents, Jude’s parents even Dominic.",I almost forgot. I’m trying to believe again.,Talk to Jude. He really does love you.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,I didn’t realize you were home. What time is it?,It’s not as bad as you make it out to be.,Kei. It’s not as bad as you think.,She needs you to reassure her Jude. She’s feeling guilty.,"If nothing happened like she said, why is she feeling guilty?"
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Kei. I love you.,I never thought you did not. I just wondered if…you loved me enough.,Enough for what? To die for you? To give up my life for you?,I would never ask you to give me those things. I would never ask you to do those things for me. Of what use would it be if you died for me? What use?,What happened? When did you stop believing that I loved you enough?,"It was never any one particular moment or thing. I guess it was a gradual erosion of things. Little things, that ordinarily shouldn’t have mattered but they did.",Like?,"Good morning kisses. I really missed those. It wasn’t that I thought… you’d be in hurry, dashing out to keep an early morning appointment. I was happy that you were moving up the ladder and that things were looking up for you and that you were enjoying it but I felt left behind. Like you weren’t including me, like you had gone ahead of me and that I was less than you needed.",How could you ever think that Baby?,I had no reason not to think it. Somewhere we stopped saying ‘I love you’ and I guess at some point I began to wonder. Wonder whether I was a bother. Whether…you still loved me the way you use to.,Is that why? Was that the angle Majid used?,I believe you. I believe that nothing happened.,How did you…?,"He came by the hospital the day after your accident. He was distraught. No, he didn’t say anything. He was distraught.",He never called.,Do you…love him? Would you rather be with him?,"No! I love you. I now realize that I always have. I was acting out my discontent like a child. Instead of telling you how I felt, I allowed my fear of…displeasing you, worrying you shut me up and see how it turned out!",When did I begin to terrify you so much that you felt that you couldn’t talk to me?,I’m not terrified of you. I was angry at you. And I acted out by sulking instead of talking to you. I felt you were distant from me and instead of drawing closer I put more space between the two of us till I couldn’t hear you anymore. And neither could you hear me.,"I love you Kei. I have never stopped and so help me God, I will never stop.",I’m so sorry.,So am I Kei. So am I.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,When did this come in?,Last night after you had left.,You can go Nne.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Good morning Ma. How are you feeling today?,Good morning. You are cheerful this morning.,It is a good morning isn't it?,It is indeed if it has you so...excited.,Did you get the letter?,I have a letter?,The invitation to this year's Forum.,Oh! That!,"Yes Ma, that!",I've seen it and I don't think I'm going to go.,Why?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,I'm scared.,Why?,I don't know if I can handle seeing him.,Why do you think he was the one who sent it?,"Funke, we are bigger than we were, but we are not that big yet. It could only have been...Majid.",Are you afraid he'll cause any trouble? You can...tell Oga Jude. I'm sure he'll do something about it.,That is the other problem. Is it wise for Oga Jude to become involved with this? Maybe it's just best if I don't go.,Madam please don't be offended. Do you still like that oga?,"No, not like before.",Then there is no problem. I think you should attend. The business we can get from there will be very useful. Consider it his payment for all the wahala he caused you.,Payment indeed!,"If you're still worried about attending by yourself, you really should ask Oga to go with you, even Aunty Clara or Aunty Bimpe.",I've heard you Funke ahn! Go back to work jo! Who did you leave the store floor for now?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,You are looking well Stranger.,Hello Majid. It has indeed been awhile.,I've been trying to get a hold of you. Do you not pick your calls anymore?,I do.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,So you've been avoiding me.,Perhaps.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Are you upset with me?,Why would I be?,Keira stop this. How are you doing? I haven't seen you since you got out of hospital. Are you doing okay?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,I'm fine Majid. Thanks for asking.,Are you here alone?,"Yes, I am.",Can I ask you something?,You've been asking them since you sat.,"Do you really think I would have just kept away, forgotten you like that? Why didn't you ever call me?"
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Why would I call you?,I came by the hospital the day after your accident. Did 'he' not tell you?,My husband?,"Yes, he did. And no, I didn't think to call you.",Why Keira?,I thought we were getting to be good friends.,Was that where we were heading? Majid they are about to begin. Can we keep this for later?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,You're in a hurry!,"Yes, I am.",What's the hurry? You've been acting weirdly all day.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,You do have a nerve Majid. I'll give you that.,How...what do you mean?,What are you trying to do? Married! That's what I am! I will not go down this road with you!,You are causing a scene! What's gotten into you?,Then don't give me reason to! Walk away Majid. You've done quite enough! We have done quite enough!,What are you trying to insinuate Keira? What road?,"The road where my head was spinning so wildly that I almost lost my life, my friends and my husband, that road! It might have been fun and games to you, but the stakes were just too high for me. I almost lost everything!",Does that mean we can't even be friends?,Can we be that? Friends and nothing more?,It...Keira!
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,What's this?,He wants to talk to you.,I won't be here that long. I just want to apologize...and say a few things.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,I am not sure I had a right to be hurt.,"I just wanted you to know that. I apologize if I made things difficult. I never, never set out to hurt you."
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,What happened? How did that come about?,"Jude, why do always do this?",How long had you known him?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,I don't love him.,How long Keira?,I met him shortly before our wedding. It was just...one of those meetings and we didn't see each other until around the time of his father's birthday party last year.,You met him again at the party?,"No, not at the party. He came by my shop earlier that day. I never found out if it had been just a coincidence or if he sought me out.","Jude, talk to me. Shout at me, rage at me, yell at me just do anything but be silent. Please Jude. I am sorry. So very sorry that I put us through this but you are shutting me out again. Please Jude.",Jude.,Keira I need some space. Just a few hours. I need to think things through.,And when you've thought things through? What happens? Jude please. I. am. sorry.,"Kei, it's for better or worse."
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,I...I just need to come to terms with a few things Kei. We will be fine.,Don't shut me out again Jude. Don't...
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,You have a funny way of showing that you're concerned.,It shouldn't be of any concern to you.,"I would say that as her friend, it is.",Friend! Is that what we are calling it these days? Friends?,"Tell me, friend, is it when...do you honestly think I would just let you wreck my home? Let you take my wife away from me?",It would be over my dead body! You are just the sort that would make her miserable.,Why? Because you couldn't keep her happy? Because she is more woman than you apparently can handle and so I can't?,"Because she's mine! We stood before the Lord and we made vows, in His Name! And in spite of what's going on with us, if there is one thing I can trust, it's that Keira loves the Lord and she will not take His Name lightly.",Then what was she doing with me?! Why was she with me?,"Beccause we are all human. We all fall short sometimes. Keira would come around and when she does, if she had ended up with you, she would have hated herself.",Why would you be so sure of that?,Because she loves me as well.,You may have beclouded her mind for awhile but it's me that she loves.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,I take it you saw them.,I take it you saw them.,Here we go again! Are you going to retreat into hibernation again?,I'm fine. I'll be fine.,So check this out.

Are the ladies in this city blind?",Speak for yourself.,I need to leave this town for a while.,I thought you said you were fine.,And I am. I just need some time to...just some time.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,What if he is there?,Keira! You have not even opened it. How do you know that he sent it this time?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Jude! This is serious!,Okay. What do you want me to do when you won't open it?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Would you open it for me?,It's an invitation to this year's Forum as usual but...,"It's not to you per se but to the MD, Beautiful things Gallery and Gift stores. Oh! That would be you wouldn't it?",And it's not from Nuclear Inc! It's from the Planning and hosting committee!,Why aren't you surprised? It's a big deal!,Of course it's a big deal.,Jude?,You do remember that my firm is on the planning and hosting committee for the Forum?,Are you saying...? Did you wrangle this for me?,Thank you.,You're welcome.

It was getting somewhat stuffy so I came out for some fresh air.,You were a bit overwhelmed. They are a bit much. You get used to them though. Give it time.
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Come on. I want you to meet Banjo and his sister. They’re pretty nice people so no worries.,Hey! You guys! Don’t you dare start out with me!

Asked Maggie after you and she was babbling something.,I do not babble. And stop making those gooey eyes at my friend! Alero ignore him. He’s an inveterate flirt!
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,Hey Ally. I thought the guys intended to keep you for a bit there. They all….,Would it be alright if I went on home…to your house?,Why? What’s wrong?,I just…I’m feeling a bit dizzy. Perhaps I just need to lie down for awhile.,Did you eat something…? Did something happen over there?
665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,I can go on by myself. You don’t need to leave on my account. And it isn’t that far. I know my way home…to your house.,Ally?

665828__a-rose-by-any-other-name,I've been thinking of something but I thought I should clear it with you first? You know that briefcase we retrieve from Doctor Greene and his clan is still with us at the HQ.,It's evidence though. I thought of it but wasn't sure if it was something I could lay my hands on.,Well the good doctor said that most of it was untested stuff and that he couldn't say for sure what they would do exactly. Perhaps there's something there that could help you.,How do you propose we lay our hands on it?
255051__changing-direction,Is Ma out?,Have I said something wrong?,Why did you have to ask that question? You should mid your won business.,She has a right to know.
255051__changing-direction,Your mother left.,She left?,"She packed her bags, and left. Not long afterwards, I heard that she's living with another man.",No!,It's true.,Seven years ago.,I don’t understand.,"Neither do I. Everything was fine, the next thing I know, we're enkundleni, and your mother wants the marriage dissolved. She refused to give a reason, but she threatened to kill herself if she was forced to come back here. No pleading from my family or hers would get her to come back. I didn't know then, but I know now, that she had another man.",Ma wouldn't do that!,"She did, Bazilile. I know the man she’s with now, we drink together sometimes, at MaZondo's.",No!,"It’s not possible. Ma wouldn't leave, not for no reason. She's not like that."
255051__changing-direction,Where’s Ma?,Didn’t Baba tell you?,It's hard to believe.,It's true.,What went wrong?,"Nothing, she just left. She made Baba a laughing stock.

How are things?,So-so. I'll get you some food.,Can I help?,"No, the children will bring the food.",How do you feel?,"Better for sitting in the shade, and being sure that I'll get food.","How are you, my friend?",I'm in shock.,Why?,I just found out that my parents are no longer together.,Yes.,What happened?,Only they can say.,Do you know where my mother is?,"Yes, it's not far from here.",Will you tell me how to get there?,Of course.
255051__changing-direction,Do you have children?,No.,"Why not? Before long, you won’t be able to have any.",I don't want any. Are you married?,I wouldn't be in my parents’ home if I was.,I thought you were visiting. Didn't you get married?,"I did. He went to work at a mine and came back with another woman.

I'd never dreamed I'd be treated like property, but your father treated me as if I was property, Bazi. Kele, leave this person. Jealous people never improve, they only get worse, I know. Jealousy starts off with little things, then he goes everywhere with you. When people visit, he says you can't see them. He wants you to dress a certain way, so other men don’t steal you. He stops you going to church, stops you visiting your family or friends, then he locks you up. He might eventually kill you. Don't put up with it, my child, leave, for your own sake.

Jealousy is infantile and subhuman. Why would a woman your age, with your beauty, brains, and all the money you obviously have, need to be jealous? What do you have to be insecure about?

Eventually, I realised he was insecure, and thought himself unlovable, so he made me feel unlovable, thinking that would make me cling to him and love only him. All that did was send me away. Unless you want to spend your life as a bitter and lonely woman, you need to find a way to get over your jealousy. I’m going to join my husband."

The day you came to work, I’d spent the night with the board of directors, some bank officials and the fraud squad, going through everything. When you arrived, the bank officials watched our interaction. I had to stay, and clear your name. Behaving other than I did would have made them suspend us both. I went to your home that evening to tell you what was going on, but you weren’t there, and you haven’t been there since then. I asked Kele where you were, she didn’t know.",You asked Kele? Why?,"Because I needed to find you, and tell you what I was doing. We’re partners, Bazi. I would never hang you out to dry.",Hmm.,"I’ve been worried about you, we both have.

How much longer do you have to keep this up?,Two weeks.,I’m sure I can last two weeks.,"Bazi, I broke the rules the first month of this diet, before I was able to only eat what’s prescribed on a daily basis.",I’ll be fine.,"If you’re not, I won’t hold it against you. It’s the thought that counts.","When you reach the goal weight, can I feed you, and get you back to your usual size?","Yes, that would be nice.","Bazi, there’s someone to see Kele.",Can I help you?,Not really. I’m waiting for my mother.,Your mother?,Kele Ngobese.,What?,Kele’s my mom. She invited me to dinner?,Is that right?,I’m here.,Oh.,"Hi, Mme.","Hi, Brenda.","When did you have time to make a child this age, and why don’t I know about her?",Sweetheart…,Why have you been hiding her?,I haven’t been hiding her!,Then why don’t I know about her?,I’ll explain. Let’s sit down.,Talk to me.,Well?,I got pregnant in my first year at university. I was eighteen.,You didn’t tell me.,I gave the baby up for adoption. Brenda turned up here while you were in Australia. I haven’t been hiding her. It had never occured to me that she’d want to find me. I’d have told you about her if I’d thought she’d come into my life. I meant to get here before she did and tell you about her.,Hi.,Hi.,Brenda was here for our wedding.,Really?,"Brenda, this is Bazi, my wife. Your being here makes me assume you accept our union, am I right?","Yes, you are.","I’m so glad to hear that. Bazi, this is my daughter Brenda. She and I would like to get to know each other. I know you’re in shock, but I’m hoping that with time, you’ll be okay with me having her in my life.","She’s joining us for dinner, I hope you’ll be nice to her.","I need a shower, so I’ll have to leave you two alone. Please don’t fight.","Don’t worry, Mme."
255051__changing-direction,You don’t speak like a South African.,Excuse me?,"When you speak English, your accent doesn’t sound South African.",I grew up in England. My parents went into exile when I was about a year old.,How long have you been in South Africa?,Just over two weeks. I came to find Mme.,Why?,Excuse me?,"You’re about twenty six years old, why didn’t you come sooner, if you were interested in finding her?","I wasn’t, until my parents died last year. I found myself alone in the world, and I didn’t like it, so I decided to find my mother. I hoped she’d be willing to let me be her family."
255051__changing-direction,Where are you staying?,At a bed and breakfast.,How long are you in town?,I leave in five days.,Do you like Joburg?,"I don’t know. I haven’t seen much of it, or much of anyone. I don’t feel like socialising, or being a tourist."
255051__changing-direction,Can Brenda spend the night?,"She sounds lonely. You’re the only person she knows in this big city. She can even spend the rest of her stay here. You or I will take her to work with us, or she can stay here with MaBanda. That has to be better then being alone and lonely in a strange bed and breakfast in a strange land.",I don’t even know her. She could be fake for all I know.,Have you had her investigated?,No!,Why not?,I don’t want to find out she’s a fake.,She might not be. Can she spend the night?,"If she robs us, it’ll be your fault.",Do you want me to leave?,No.,Would you like to spend the night?,"Yes, spend the night, and er…the rest of your stay here, if you like.",You’d let me stay here?,Er…yes.,You don’t know me. I could rob you or kill you.,"Yes, you could, but I reckon you wouldn’t have travelled half way across the world to meet a woman who might or might not have been alive, so you could rob her if you met her. It would have been a whole lot more lucrative to rob someone in England.",Are you okay with this?,Yes.,What do I call you?,What do you mean?,"Do I call you stepmme, aunty, or do I call you by your name?","We don’t call the wives of our parents by name, you’ll call her Mme Mkhize, and continue to call me Mme.","Thank you for inviting me to stay. I’ll spend the night, then, if you’re still sure tomorrow about me staying with you, I’ll check out of the bed and breakfast. Otherwise, I’ll catch cabs between here and there.",I’m suddeny hungry. I think we should go for pizza.,That sounds good.
255051__changing-direction,"I’m serious. I didn’t expect you to have a car, or live in a mansion, Mme. I had steeled myself to live in a hut. I brought tinned food and bottled water in case I couldn’t eat what you eat.",Are you pleasantly surprised by the reality or are you disappointed?,I’m not sure. My focus is on you and me. The rural life or city life is a very minor detail.
255051__changing-direction,I didn’t know you were a keen dancer.,It never came up.,Why did you never suggest we do it?,I didn’t think the jealous personality could stomach it.,"You were right, then, but I’m not jealous now. We’ll do it more often.",Are you sure about Brenda being here?,Yes.,"Do you want to come to work with me Brenda? If you get bored, you can come back here or go and check out of the bed and breakfast, and bring your things here.","You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. Please, please don’t cry.",Thank you for asking me.,Will you come to work with me?,Yes.,Can I take you to check out of the bed and breakfast afterwards?,I’d like that.,Brenda is your what?,Our daughter.,Since when?,"Last night. You’re her uncle, and I expect you to be there for her if she should need you."
255051__changing-direction,Hi.,Hi. How come I didn’t see you at your mother’s?,My family thought a little time apart would do us good.,"I would have felt less alone seeing a friendly face. Your uncles were like bulldogs. I thought they’d throw us out. If Bob and Tom hadn’t been with me, I’d have left before your uncles decided to put me in a pot and cook me.",They would never have cooked you.,You mean they’d have eaten me raw?,They don’t eat people.,It didn’t look that way to me.,They have nothing but admiration for you.,I don’t believe that.,"They say you showed great determination, and they’re sure you’ll look after me well.","I will, but I don’t know that I can meet your uncles again.","You will, but it will be under more hospitable conditions.",Do you want to eat?,We ate already. Have you eaten?,I was waiting for you.,I’ll sit with you while you eat.,I’m not really hungry. Where’s Brenda?,"In her room. She loved meeting Mme and the rest of the family. I’m dropping her off with them tomorrow, then I’ll fetch her home the day after that. Come, I’ll help you to bed."
255051__changing-direction,How did my clothes get here from my other home?,"I spoke to your landlady, and told her I was your wife.",And she believed you?,"I was driving your car, and I had a certified copy of your ID. I had to do some serious fast talking, then she let me take your things. Fortunately, you had paid for the month so she wouldn’t be losing by your leaving.",Did you get everything?,Yes. Do you mind?,"No, thank you for taking care of it.",How did your visit go with your Nkgono?,Nkgono?,"Your grandmother, Kele’s mom.","It was nice, I enjoyed spending time with her, aunty and my cousins.",Would you like to meet my mom?,Yes.,"She lives in the rural areas. I can only get there over the weekend. If you can extend your stay, I’d love to take you and Kele to visit her.",That sounds great!,Do you want to go and visit Ma with me?,"Of course, I like her.","I’m thinking of inviting Brad and Stan to go with us. They’re having problems, and I think a change of scene will do them good.",Have they ever been to the rural areas?,I don’t know.,It should be interesting for all of us. Are we staying with your Baba?,"No, we’ll stay with Ma and her husband. The last time I was there, Buti came to try and bully me into leaving, it didn’t work.",When were you there?,"I needed a change after I was accused of fraud, so I went there.",How was your Ma?,"Fine, and happy. Now that I think about it, she never used to smile while she was with Baba. I’m glad she found a man who makes her happy."
255051__changing-direction,We made good time.,"We made crazy time. Why couldn’t we have left at five this morning, after a good night’s rest?","We’ll have almost twenty-four hours with Ma because we drove this way. Good, here comes Mkwanazi.",Who is he?,Ma’s husband.,"I’m so glad it’s you my child. When a car with an engine that big stops at your gate at night, its usually bad news. Do you come with bad news?","No, Baba, everything is fine.",I’ll open the gate for you.,"How are you, my child?","I’m fine, Ma, how are you?",We are well. Who are all these people?,"Why are these white boys here? Are you in trouble? Have you been arrested for fraud, Bazilile?","No, Ma! Everything’s fine. These are my friends.",Your friends?,"I’m sorry I didn’t tell you I was bringing guests. Show me where they’ll sleep, and I’ll start cleaning their huts.",What kind of friends are they? What black girl has white boys as friends? Are you sure you’re not in trouble?,Very sure.,You’re marrying one of them.,No! It’s nothing like that.,Then what’s going on?,They are our friends. Where will they sleep?
255051__changing-direction,Where will Bazi be?,She’ll stay here and help with the cooking.,Oh.,We’d love to come.,"Can I come, too?",Er…,"I’ve never been to the rural areas, and I want to see as much of them as I can. Please can I come?",Alright.,I’ll get my camera.,"It will be fine, Baba.",Whoever heard of a woman going walking with men? I want to show these boys my herd of cattle. What will we do with that girl?,"She’ll look at the cattle, too.",How has she managed to never go to rural areas?,She grew up in England.,I thought she was your friend’s child?,"Yes, she is, but she was raised by other people, who took her to England.","Why was she raised by other people? Why couldn’t you raise her, Kele?","I had her when I was still in school. I couldn’t look after her, so I gave her up for adoption.",What’s adoption?,Don’t you look like a great hunter!,You like my outfit?,You look as if you’re going on a safari.,"This is the closest I’ve gotten to the wilds, I figure I should use the outfit, and not let it gather dust. Can we go?",What’s adoption?,It’s…,"Some couples, who can’t have children, register with an organisation that can give them children who will be given up by women who have children that they can’t raise. The point is to let the couples get children who would otherwise be thrown away, or grow up in horrible circumstances.",Couldn’t you have taken that child home to your mother?,"She’d have killed me. She and Ntate worked hard to get me to university and if I’d told them I was pregnant, Ma would have been heart broken. She found out about Brenda last week.",Did you never wonder about your child?,No. I knew she had parents who loved her and would look after her better than I ever could.,"I don’t understand that. Alright, girls, let’s get to making lunch.",We’ll do it.,"I want to do it. I don’t often get guests, it’s a treat to cook for them.","This is great, Ma, thank you."
255051__changing-direction,Wait for us.,This is a good time to come here. It’s not late enough for most people to be cooking as most of them are still working their fields.
255051__changing-direction,Let’s go.,"No, let’s see this."
255051__changing-direction,Are you alright?,"Yes, thanks."
255051__changing-direction,"I can’t marry you, Mkhize, I’m already married, to him.",What did you say?,I just told this man I can’t marry him because I’m married to you.,What?
255051__changing-direction,What’s going on here?,This has gone far enough. I won’t tolerate my wife marrying another man.,What?,I paid amalobolo!,"My wife and I separated for a short while, but now…",Your wife? What wife?,We met and married when I was at school.,Why didn’t you tell me you were married?,No one is married to a woman unless he’s paid amalobolo.,"We were going to get divorced, but we’ve changed our minds.","He’s not married to her. He’s rescuing her, Stan. Can you hear me?","Stan, Stan!",Bazi.,"Brad is not married tothat woman, he’s rescuing her from making a mistake, do you understand?",He’s not married to her?,"Of course not! You know that. You know that, right?","Yes, yes of course. He’s married to…","Yes. Now, you need to go get him and her out to the car before things get ugly. Can you do that? Can you get them?",Yes.,"Good, I’ll get the car, and bring it to the door. Go."
255051__changing-direction,Where are they?,We all have to pick up essentials and get out of here.
255051__changing-direction,"What happened back there, child?",Please speak in English so the men who rescued MaMzizi can understand.,I couldn’t marry him. Being married to him would have killed me.,Why did you agree to marry him?,My father’s dying. He needed money for surgery. Mkhize offered him cattle in exchange for a bride. I agreed to be the bride because I didn’t know how he is. I spent time with him and discovered how jealous he is. I don’t know how you lived so long with him.,Neither do I. What will you do?,"I can’t go back there, I’d rather die than do that. Maybe I’ll kill myself.",That’s stupid.,What else will I do?,"Get a job, and get yourself a life.",My family will have to return the cattle.,"If you get a good job, you can pay for your father’s hospitalisation.",Can he not qualify for funding from some organisations?
255051__changing-direction,There’s plenty of room for everyone to spend the night here.,"MaMzizi, I can help you get a job if you want to work.",You’re all being so nice. I didn’t think I’d still be alive by the end of today.,"Don’t cry, child. Get a job as Stan says.",I have contacts with NGOs. I can talk to some of them and see if they can’t help your father.,You’re all so kind.,What’s your name?,Nothando.,"Welcome to Joburg, Nothando.",Let’s eat.,Will you be safe when you return to your home?,"Don’t worry, we’ll be safe. Your brothers were in the church and they saw everything. They won’t let our property be destroyed. They are big, strong men, no one will want to mess with them.",My brothers?,My sons.,"I’m glad, I don’t want either of you in danger from Baba and Buti or from MaMzizi’s family."
255051__changing-direction,"Stan, are you married?",Yes.,Is Bazi your wife?,"No! No, she’s not my wife.",You act like you’re married to her.,I don’t understand.,"I’ve watched the way you interact with her and talk to her. You even bathed together at my home. If you’re not yet married to each other, you need to get round to it.",Who are you married to?,Are you ashamed of your wife?,No!,Who is she? Where is she?,"You see. You and Bazi can’t keep your eyes off each other. Bazi, I noticed a ring on your wedding finger. You need to get rid of it, so Stan can put one on you when he marries you.",Stan and I can’t marry each other.,Why not?,We’re married to other people.,You didn’t tell me!,"Sorry, Ma.",Do your father and his people know? Did they receive amalobolo?,No!,Why are you keeping it a secret?,I only got married recently.,"Who did you marry? Bazilile, who did you marry?"
255051__changing-direction,Bazilile?,I married a woman.,You married a woman?,Yes.,Tell me you’re joking.,"I’m not joking, Ma.","Bazilile, where have you ever heard of such a thing? Women do not marry other women!","It’s legal, Ma.","It shouldn’t be! It’s sick and unnatural. Whoever she is, you need to get rid of her. I won’t have my child misled by some sick…pervert.",I won’t get rid of her.,You must! What will your father say?,I don’t care.,How can you say that? You have to care!,I don’t. He and I no longer have anything to do with each other.,Because of the woman you married?,Because I speak to you.,Get rid of her.,I won’t do that.,Why not?,I love her.,"You can’t! How can you love a woman when you’re a woman? It’s just a phase, Bazilile. Get rid of this woman, and find a husband. I wouldn’t tell him I’d been with a woman, if I were you. That would be the best way to lose him.",I don’t want a man. I want the woman I’m married to.,Stop being selfish!,Selfish?,"You’re separating her from her people. How can they accept this union? Free the girl, and let her go back to her people.",Her people accepted amalobolo from me.,What?,What kind of family is this girl from? Normal people wouldn’t accept this pervesion of culture and nature.,Who is she? Who is this sick person that has misled you into going against the natural order of things?,She didn’t mislead me.,"You used to be normal. You had boyfriends, Bazilile.","They were men I knew, but they were never my boyfriends.",I’ll pray for you. I’ll tell Mfundisi and…,Don’t waste your energy.,But…,"If I can’t be with this person, then I’ll spend my life alone.",That has to be better than this sick arrangement you’ve gotten yourself into.,I won’t be separated from her.,Who is she? Where is she?,It’s me.,You?,"You told me about a man, when we met, a jealous man.","I talked of a person, not a man. I was talking about Bazi.",No!,She’s the one who was making me sad with her jealousy.,No!,They probably want to leave now.,Yes.,We’ll take them to a bed and breakfast.,Thank you.,We’re leaving.,We’ll take you to…,"There’s no need. My daughter lives closeby, she’ll fetch us.","If we can get a lift, it will make it easier on Nozipho.",We’ll get you there.,Thank you for coming and have a safe trip.,Thank you.,I’ll never see Ma again.,I’m sorry.,It’s not your fault.,It’s not yours either. You didn’t choose to be this way.
255051__changing-direction,What are you doing?,Rewriting my will.,Are you alright?,Yes.,You were upset last night.,Yes. I didn’t know it would hurt so much to lose Ma. But I’m reconciled to it now.,Are you sure?,I guess you are feeling better.,"Sit down, I made you breakfast."
255051__changing-direction,"I love you, Bazi.","I love you, too."
255051__changing-direction,Are you alright?,"I don’t want her to go, Bazi. I want her back. Why can’t she come and live here?",You can phone her.,It’s not the same!
255051__changing-direction,Can I have money for my cab?,Of course.,"I’m sorry, Mme, I couldn’t get on that plane. I’ll get a job and move out soon, and…",I’m so glad you’re back.,Really?,"I didn’t know I’d miss you so much, and we’ve only been apart a few hours. You don’t have to move out any time soon.",Let’s all get to bed.
255051__changing-direction,Happy anniversary.,"Happy anniversary to you, too.",Dinner will be in half an hour.,I’ll freshen up and join you.,Oh.,"When I asked you to marry me, I didn’t know we’d end up with two daughters.",Two?,"Brenda and Nothando. I didn’t know I’d be okay with us being parents. This time round with you, I feel secure enough to not fear that the girls, or anyone else, is taking your love from me. Thank you for being you, and for loving me."

Why don’t you light a fire in the fireplace, then come back and light my fire.",I thought you would never ask. I’ll be right back – save my place.
680717__revenge-inc,Go away. I don’t want to talk to you. Leave me alone!,"Lynn, its Harriet and Rick. Open up!",Who?,"Harriet and Rick Goodman, your two best friends. Now let us in.",No. Go back where you came from.,"You forget that I’m a trained Federal agent. I can pick this lock in 30 seconds . . . of course it might not work after that. So unless you want it destroyed, open up!","My God, Lynn. What’s happened to you! You look awful. Rick, avert your eyes until she gets something decent on.","We’ve been trying to call you for days, but we get nothing but a busy signal.","Yeah. I guess I let the battery run down on my cell phone. No, wait. I hid it under the sofa cushion. The battery’s probably dead anyway.","Well, this morning we decided . . .","You decided, dear.","As I was saying, we decided to come up here from The Farm to check on you. And it looks like it’s a good thing we did. Finish your coffee so I can put you in the shower – how long has it been, a week? I’ll get you cleaned up, dressed, and packed. We’re taking you back to our place.","I don’t want a shower, and I don’t want to leave here. Just let me wallow in my misery.","Not gonna happen, dear. We love you too much to leave you here. Now get going. You know I’m trained to get you in an arm lock and march you in there if I have to.","Oh, Okay. I’ll take a shower, but I’m not leaving here.",Find a suitcase and pack everything you can find. And keep your eyes open for guns. If you find any put them in the car.,I can’t find any clothes. All the drawers are empty . . . except for a Glock 15 pistol.,Look in the laundry room. She probably hasn’t washed anything in weeks.
680717__revenge-inc,Should we wake her up?,"She hasn’t been sleeping much. I guess the motion of the car lulled her to sleep. It’s like when our kids were little and wouldn’t go to sleep, so we would put them in their car seat and drive around the neighborhood. They would be out in a few minutes.",She sure seems comfortable. Can we just leave her here and go inside?,I don’t know. What if she wakes up and panics? I think I’ll stay in the car with her until she wakes up.,"You want me to bring you anything? A snack, or a drink?",No. I’ll just doze in the seat until I hear her making noises.
680717__revenge-inc,Shhh. It’s Okay now. Harriet’s here. Try to calm down.,Oh . . . it was another one of my dreams. Jack was there again . . . He was trapped in a fire in my Colorado home. His clothes were on fire and I couldn’t get to him. His skin turned to black ashes as I watched. It was awful.
680717__revenge-inc,"We’re at the Farm, aren’t we. I recognize some of the furniture. I’ve been here before . . . and Jack was with us. Oh, Jack! Where are you. Why did you leave me? I miss you so much. I want to be with you.",We need to leave her alone for now. Maybe she’ll go back to sleep. I’ll sleep in the guest bedroom with the door open so I can hear her when she wakes up.
680717__revenge-inc,Good morning! I’m glad to see you’re up and around. Did you sleep well?,"Yeah, after I cried for a couple of hours. Maybe I cried some of the pain out, because I feel a lot better.","Crying is one of the best therapies around – for women anyway. For men, not so much. It’s just not manly. It shows their vulnerability.",Jack could cry when he got too emotional. It didn’t embarrass him to cry in front of me.
680717__revenge-inc,That brought back a good memory of Jack. I felt so close to him when he shared his emotions. I need to keep bringing up the good memories to overpower the bad ones.,"Have you thought about getting some grief counseling, Lynn? When my sister lost her husband she was really depressed. I talked her into seeing someone and after a couple of months, with the help of anti-depressants, she was functioning again.",No! I don’t want to share my hurt with anyone – especially a stranger.,"So you just want to wallow in your pain, huh.",and I don’t need your advice either.,"Someone needs to be honest with you, dear. I’m your best friend and even if you get mad at me when I try to help, it won’t stop me. You have to talk about your pain, your memories, the joy you and Jack shared.","Yes, you’re right. You’re my BFF and if I can’t share it with you it will kill me.","Rick and I are there for you now, but think about seeing a therapist later on."
680717__revenge-inc,"Good morning, Ladies. Up early I see.","So what’s the plan, girls? Are you two going shopping today?","There is no plan, Rick. We take this one day at a time.",You have to have a plan! Otherwise you’re just drifting on the sea of . . . of life.,"Drifting is all I can do right now, Rick. It took all the motivation I could pull together just to get up this morning. Depression sucks your motivation out of you. You know you need get up and do things, but just thinking about them tires you out.","Well, I can’t drift. I need to be doing something . . . moving toward a goal.","Fine, Rick. You go after your goals like fixing the sink faucet, or cleaning out the garage. Lynn and I will drift wherever our thoughts and conversation take us. When you finish those goals, let me know and I’ll get out my Honey Do List.","I stepped right into that one, didn’t I dear. You two let me know if I can help in any way. I’m going to go to my study and check out the latest financial news."
680717__revenge-inc,I’ve only heard bits and pieces of how you and Jack first met. Fill me in on the details.,"Well, it all started with an email I sent Jack . . . no, wait  a minute. Let me go back to the real beginning. Jack and I grew up in a small town in the West Virginia coal country. We had eighth grade science class together and when he came into the room I was captivated. Tall – over six feet – well built, and good looking. And as I would soon find out, smarter than anyone else I knew. He knew more about physics and chemistry than the teachers. I was still shy around boys and didn’t go out with them yet, so I just admired him from a distance.",Wait a minute! You two knew each other back in eighth grade?,"Well, I didn’t really know him yet. But I noticed him stealing glances at me in class and in the hallway. I don’t remember how it came about, but he asked me to go to a movie with him. I said I would have to check with my mother first. But there we were the next Saturday sitting in the small local theater watching, of all things, Love is a Many Splendored Thing. I didn’t realize it until a few years later, but that movie wasn’t appropriate for kids our age. It was about a married newspaper correspondent having an affair with a woman doctor in China. Just before he had to leave she told him that he had knocked her up.","Well that’s what they called it in our part of the country. Anyway, I don’t think either of us paid much attention to the plot. I was sitting there wondering if he would try to hold my hand and wiping my palms on my skirt every couple of minutes so they wouldn’t be sweaty just in case he did. He was probably trying to get up the courage to hold my hand and wondering what to do about his own sweaty hands.",Where did it go from there? Were you high school sweethearts?,No. My sister in Florida died so I had to move down there to raise her children.,When was the next time you saw him?,"Forty years later. I was divorced and living in Telluride, Colorado. I spent a lot of time with my granddaughter, Selena . . ."
680717__revenge-inc,"Do you want any more coffee, Lynn?",Okay. If you are sure. I don’t want to upset you.
680717__revenge-inc,"I knew Jack was smart, but he actually has some patents? What for?","Mostly stuff for military use. I saw that the last couple of patents listed an address in the Washington D.C. area, so I went to Whitepages.com to find a phone number, but it didn’t come up with a match. There was a listing for Jackson Joshua Preston, Jr. out in California though, so I called him up and explained I was an old friend of his father’s and wanted to get his telephone number. He was hesitant about that, but I did manage to get an email address out of him. That’s when we started exchanging emails.",Were they romantic? Did you have an online flirtation with him?,"No, nothing like that. He sent me instructions for the science project, and we summarized our lives for each other. After half-hearted invitations to visit if we were ever in the other’s neighborhood the emails stopped. I found out later that he had more important things to do.",So when did he first show up at your place?,"A month or so later he calls me from Grand Junction and asks if I would like to meet him for lunch. I, of course, say ‘There aren’t any good restaurants in Telluride. Why don’t you come to my place and I’ll fix us something.’ So an hour later Jack shows up at my door, we eat lunch and talk over old times for the rest of the afternoon. He says he wants to get down into town before dark to find a motel room and I say ‘Stay here. I have extra bedrooms and we’re both adults. So we had dinner and a few glasses of wine and went to bed.",You slept with him the first night?,"No, we went off to separate bedrooms and met again at breakfast.","Wow, what a story!","Just wait ‘til you hear the rest of it. It gets better – much better. So there we were, ham and scrambled eggs and I ask him what kind of work he did before he retired. He starts in with a line of bull about . . .","Hi, girls. What’s for breakfast? I’m starved.","You must be telepathic. Lynn was just talking about breakfast. Let me whip up something. How do you like your eggs, Lynn?","I need to talk with you two about the Forseti fund. I just checked on our account and it’s doing nicely. After Winston was killed we decided to divide the $6 million five ways, with each of us getting $1.2 million – that’s grown to about $1.3 million since then. Now that Jack is no longer with us, I moved his $1.3 million over into Lynn’s account, leaving her with $2.6 million.","No, that’s not right. Jack’s share should be equally divided among the rest of us. I don’t want any special favors.","There’s no special favors involved here, Lynn. Jack worked harder than any of us to get Winston out, so he earned that money fair and square. I manage the account and I have made the decision. No argument allowed.","He’s right Lynn. I know you don’t have any use for it now, but it will be there whenever you need it. Maybe you can start a new career with it.",Not likely.,"Okay, that’s settled. Go on with your story about how you and Jack got together. Rick will enjoy hearing it.",You mean I missed some of it? You have to go back to the beginning so I can hear it all.,"Another time, Rick. Go ahead Lynn. You and Jack were at you place in Colorado and he was answering your question about what he did for a living.","Right. He told me that after college and graduate school he spent the rest of his career working for the Government as an engineer on several different projects that took him all over the world. When I asked him what kind of projects he got evasive and changed the subject. I learned later that he was a secret agent for the FRA – sort of like the FBI but with different letters. I thought maybe he wasn’t really retired because he spent a lot of time on his computer and telephone, but he wouldn’t talk about it.","I think that’s when he called us, Rick. I was in the hospital recovering from an attempted murder by motor vehicle when he called and asked about some work I had done when I was with the FRA that hadn’t been closed out properly. He found a total of six cases like, that and eventually discovered the agents involved in three of them had died recently under suspicious circumstances.","Yeah, he told me about that later. He eventually opened up to me a little and told me some of what was going on. What he didn’t tell me was that he was being chased by some people who were trying to kill him, but I wouldn’t find that out for a few more days. It was during those days that we started to grow close to each other. But that’s when the two men showed up at my door and all hell broke loose. We had to leave at night in a snowstorm over some mountain roads with them hot on our tail. After we finally got clear we met up with you two.","When are you going to write a book about all your adventures, Lynn? It would be a bestseller for sure.",I have already lived through it once. I don’t want to relive it.
680717__revenge-inc,"Hello, Lynn. It’s me Jack. You look like you’re asleep, but I know you can hear me. I want to tell you something important. I will always be here near you whenever you need me. Just think of me and I’ll be there. You can let go of your grief because I never really went away. I’m here, watching over you, always.","Jack? Jack, where are you? I can’t see you. I want you back, alive. I want to grow old with you."
680717__revenge-inc,"Good morning, Harriet.","Oh, you scared me! I didn’t hear you come in over the sizzling potatoes. Did you sleep good?",Sort of.,What does that mean?,"Well, I think Jack came into my room and talked to me.",Just a second. Let me get these potatoes off the burner so I can pay full attention to you. . . . There. Now did I just hear what I thought I heard?,I think Jack came and talked to me last night.,That’s what I thought I heard.
680717__revenge-inc,"That’s interesting, sweetie. What did you hear Jack say?","He said he would never leave me, that he would always be there for me.",It could have been the wind. It was really whistling through the trees last night. Maybe your mind interpreted it as Jack’s voice . . . telling you what you wanted to hear,"No, it seemed more real than that.",Were you awake?,"Yes . . . at least I think so. I sat up and turned on the light to look for him. . . . or did I dream that? I just don’t know, Harriet.",What happened after he spoke to you?,As I was falling back asleep I felt him snuggle up to my back . . . the way we always slept.,Have you thought about my suggestion to see someone – a professional counselor who would understand what you’re struggling with a lot better than I can?,"No, but after last night I guess I need to. . . . But what if the counselor makes Jack go away? I don’t want to lose him.","That’s a chance you’ll have to take, dear. Think of it like this. If somehow Jack’s spirit is visiting you, he won’t stop just because you’re talking to a psychiatrist. But if he is an illusion, the sooner you can put that out of your head, the sooner you will be normal again . . . Well, you never were normal, but you know what I mean.",I don’t know any mind doctors around here. Do you Harriet? Actually I don’t know any psychiatrists anywhere.,"There was one at the FRA. Whenever an agent went through a traumatic experience, like killing someone, we had to spend a few sessions with him. Let me give him a call and see of he can recommend someone here in town for you.","Thanks Harriet. You’re such a special friend. You know, I have never had a close friend before . . . except for Jack of course. I just never got close to anyone. Didn’t see any need for it. But now that I have you, I can see what I’ve been missing. Confiding in someone I trust takes a huge emotional burden off me. End of discussion, though. I need to think about what you said.","Jack hired an estate lawyer as soon as we were married to put together a will and arrange for disposition of his assets if something should happen to him. He didn’t tell me, of course – he didn’t want me to worry about what might happen to him or us. We all were living on the edge for a few months where any of us could have been killed. I knew what I was into so I didn’t worry about myself. But it never occurred to me that Jack would be making arrangements.","If you don’t mind me asking, what were the arrangements?",I would rather wait until your husband joins us. I trust his judgment on these things.,Rick. Get you lazy butt out of bed and get down here!,What’s up?,"I wasn’t in any mood to listen to him. I just wanted to cover my ears and say “Na na, na na, I can’t hear you.","He told me that Jack had set up a trust fund where all his assets would automatically be transferred upon his death. There were provisions to pay off any outstanding bills and taxes, and continue to pay the bills as they came in. I was the sole trustee for the account and could transfer money in or out with a phone call. He put $100,000 in a savings account that I could access from an ATM. So far I haven’t touched any of it. It cost me nothing to live in Jack’s cabin, and I used my own ATM card to buy groceries and gas.",It sounds like Jack and his lawyer knew what they were doing. How much is in the trust fund?,"A little less than a million dollars. None of it is in investments, so there’s no risk of losing it. Unless of course the entire financial system of the United States crashes and money becomes worthless.","That could have happened if Charles Winston was running the country. I hate to say this about anyone, but Winston’s assassination was a good thing – the best outcome we could have expected from the mess he put us in.","So Rick, what should I do with this trust fund? Should I move the money somewhere else, or put it all into gold and silver like the ads on TV say?",Who is managing the fund?,Wells Fargo in Denver. We were  living at my mountain home in Telluride when he set up the account. . . .
680717__revenge-inc,"Lynn, are you awake?","Yes, I’m awake. And mostly sane again. Come on in.",What have you been doing?,Thinking.,About what?,"Lots of things, both good and bad.",So tell me about the good thoughts?,"I was wondering what I could do with myself, something I can immerse myself in, with people all around, to keep me from thinking about the bad stuff."
680717__revenge-inc,I know someone who does. David Cramer.,"Cramer. What could I do for Cramer Security and Investigations Company, CSIC? Dave was Jack’s good friend since college. He would hire me out of pity and I don’t want that.","I would bet he doesn’t have a hacker as good as you are, and you’ve proven yourself with a gun. He knows you wouldn’t be afraid to use it. Besides, most of his detectives are men. He doesn’t have a middle aged, knockout redhead on his staff. He could use you for undercover work because, at five-nine with green eyes and a figure to die for, you don’t look like a detective.",Let me think about it. Don’t you or Rick call him about this. I’ll take care of it myself.,"Dave, this is Rick. How are you doing?","Busy, as usual. Our reputation keeps spreading, which brings in more clients, which requires more staff, and improves our reputation. We’re caught in an endless spiral. My dreams of running a small, inconspicuous private investigator business has crashed on the rocks of success. I should just sell it and start over.",You’re not serious?,"No, just letting off steam. What’s up with you and Harriet? I miss all the action with Jack’s group. Life’s kind of dull now. I spend all my time managing the business and searching for new operatives, so I never get out in the field to have some fun.","Well, I may have a suggestion to help with the staff shortage. Lynn is struggling with Jack’s death. She spends a lot of time crying and imagining Jack is talking to her. She needs something to keep her busy. She wants to put the computer skills she learned from Jack to use. Could you use her in your business?","Hell, yes! She’s as quick as they come when it comes to learning new computer skills, and she’s pretty handy with a gun in case I need her in the field. I have no one who is really good at hacking. I tried to bring Jack into the business. He wasn’t interested, though. I would never admit it publicly, but I depend on hacking in much of our work. Send her up here and I’ll hire her on the spot.","There’s a problem with that. She made Harriet swear that she wouldn’t contact you about this. Technically she kept her word, but since I’m Harriet’s proxy we still have to stay in the shadows. Could you just sort of drop by? Pretend you didn’t know she is here? Then you could offer her the job and keep us out of the picture.","For Jack’s wife, I would do just about anything. When do you want me there?",Done. I’ll just happen to drop by unannounced and get invited to stay for dinner.,"Terrific, Dave. Thanks.",I know I’ve been a slob for the past couple of days. I’ll get cleaned up for dinner like a proper guest.,"Who could that be, Rick?","I don’t have any idea, Harriet. We don’t get many visitors out here. There’s the doorbell. I’ll get it.",Dave! Dave Cramer. It’s great to see you. What brings you out here?,"Oh, I had some business in D.C. so I decided to take the long way back to Philly to check on you two.",You promised.,I didn’t know you had company. Is that Lynn? Of course it is.,"You three can stop the act. I know what’s going on. Harriet, I’ll get back at you for this another time. But it’s great to see you, Dave. How are the wife and family?",They’re doing great. Little David is really growing up fast. He’ll be fighting the girls off in no time.,I have dinner in the oven. Lynn would you set the table?,"Since you know why I’m here, Lynn, I won’t beat around the bush. I’ve seen your computer skills and I’ve seen you in action in the field. I want you to come and work for me. You would be a great addition to our staff, especially with your hacking capabilities. I have no one with your experience in that area and the techniques Jack taught you are unique. In the field you think fast and act even faster when the pressure is on. That time you dressed as a maid to get into a condo and plant some hidden cameras proved that. Even when the resident came back early and surprised you, you bluffed your way out of there with the cameras in place. You know how to handle a firearm, both a pistol and a long gun. I don’t anticipate needing you in that kind of situation, but you never know what might come up. So what do you say, Lynn?",When can I start?,Give me until Monday to get an office set up for you. I’ll look for you anytime Monday morning. Do you have any idea where you might want to live?,An apartment close to your office would be nice. So I can walk to work when the weather is nice.,"I know just the place. In fact, we keep an apartment for out-of-town clients. It’s fully furnished and it’s empty at the moment, so you can move in there for a week or two until you can get into an apartment of your own, maybe even in the same complex. I’ll check to see if they have anything opening up soon.","That sounds great, Dave. Thank you so much for offering me a job. I’ll plan to be there Sunday and get set up in the apartment."
680717__revenge-inc,"So what do you have that you can wear to work, Lynn?",I have nothing but jeans and sweatshirts. All my clothes were burned up in the house fire. When I drove to Jack’s cabin I picked up the bare necessities. What does the well-dressed private investigator wear to work?,"I don’t have any idea, but knowing Dave it will be a very relaxed dress code. I’ll call him in the morning and talk to his assistant. She can give us some good ideas.",Are you going to be okay by yourself in the apartment? I could come up and stay with you for a few days.,I . . . I think I’ll be all right. I plan to work 18 hours a day so I won’t have time for self pity. But it would be nice if you could come up for a few of days. Just ‘til I get my feet on the ground.,I’ll do that. And I would feel better if you started seeing a counselor. Let me call the psychologist I know at FRA and see who he knows in Philadelphia.,"I don’t think I’m ready to open up to anyone just yet, Harriet. But see who you can find. Maybe I’ll go for just one visit.",I better go to my room while I can still walk. Thanks for being there for me Harriet.,You’re welcome.
680717__revenge-inc,"Wow. I could learn to live like this. Your place at The Farm is beautiful, Harriet, but this place is even more impressive. And that round bed – do you think Dave provides his clients with a warm body to sleep with?",It doesn’t sound like something Dave would agree with. Maybe some of the clients bring their own bed warmer. Let’s put our suitcases in our rooms and have a glass of wine.,"What’s your plan for tomorrow, Lynn.","I’ll go into the office about nine in the morning. I’m anxious to get started on whatever Dave has for me to do. And I set up an appointment with the psychiatrist you found, Dr. Barnett Hogue, for 4 p.m. I’ll stop off there on the way back from work. I should be back here around six. Maybe we can go to that Italian restaurant up the street.","You’ll probably be tired after your first day of work in quite a while, and the session with the head doctor might leave you emotionally wrung out. Let’s just call the restaurant and have it delivered.","I like the way you think. There are at least a dozen restaurants within delivery distance, so we can have something different every day. I saw a Starbuck’s across the street. I wonder if they deliver?"
680717__revenge-inc,"O’Malley here. You must be Lynn. I don’t usually have that effect on people. Let’s try that again. Hi, I’m O’Malley.","It wasn’t anything you said to me. It’s your name. That was the name a my Irish Setter that was killed a few months ago. The name brought back memories, that’s all. I don’t suppose your first name is Jasper?","No, it’s Mike. Why?","When I wanted my O’Malley to act like a ferocious attack dog, I would call her Jasper. She sent several salesmen running back down the driveway.",Did you ever replace your setter?,"No, I could no more replace her than I could my husband, Jack."
680717__revenge-inc,"So, how was your appointment, Lynn?",Worthless! Absolutely worthless.,He didn’t help you at all? What did he say?,"After I told him why I was depressed, about Jack and everything, he said ‘I can’t help you until you want to get over your depression. Here’s a prescription for antidepressants. Call me in six months’ . . . then he asked me to go out to diner – with a look that said he had something else in mind!","Are you serious? You need to report him to the police, or to the state medical board. He should lose his license for that.","I thought about that, but it wouldn’t do any good. Since it was just the two of us, he would deny it. Who would you believe, a respected psychiatrist or a crazy patient?",Well he certainly needs some kind of punishment. And you’re probably not the first woman he’s made a pass at. Someone needs to stop him.
680717__revenge-inc,"O.K Dave, I get the message. It’s not cool to hug the boss in front of other employees. I just thought with all we’ve been through in the past several months, we’re all – you, me, Harriet, Rick and Tom – like family.","We are Lynn, but I have to maintain my cold-hearted boss image in front of them so they’ll think I know what I’m doing. Margaret and I will have you over for dinner next week and you’ll get the hugging you can stand.","So, are you all settled into the company apartment? How do you like it?",It’s absolutely fantastic. I have never in my life lived in a place that fancy. I’m afraid I’ll get used to it and never want to go back to Jack’s cabin. I hope when they have an apartment ready for me it’s not so luxurious . . . or so huge.,It won’t be. We rented the biggest apartment in the building and then brought in our own decorator to make it as impressive as possible for our clients. I’ve asked them to furnish your place when it’s ready so you won’t have to go shopping for furniture and accessories. They’ll work with you on that so there won’t be any surprises. Margaret would like to help if that’s all right with you.,That will be great. It will give us a chance to get to know each other.,"With that settled, let’s talk about your job – what I would like to start you out with. I have a good idea of your skills, both with computers and with a gun, but I’ll keep you away from any cases where a gun might be necessary for now.","This divorce case needs a little internet detective work to find out of either party has some undeclared income or assets. Both parties have submitted financial asset declarations that the judge will use to rule on who gets what. The problem is that sometimes the husband, or the wife, has other assets they don’t declare, like a secret bank account. In this case the wife hired us because she suspects the husband is hiding an investment account. She says he’s been renting an expensive condo for his mistress, but their joint bank account doesn’t show any suspicious charges. He’s a financial manager for an investment broker company, so he wouldn’t have any trouble opening his own account.",Where should I start looking?,"He might have opened the account with his own firm, although that would be foolish because it might be discovered. So start with a search on his name and his Social Security number and see what comes up.",What about chasing it from the other end – where the money is going? He might have his monthly statements sent to the woman’s condo. A little prying into the apartment rental company’s records might show us the source of the money.,"That’s a good idea, Lynn, but the wife doesn’t know where the condo is located. Do the best you can and try not to do anything illegal, like hacking into financial accounts.","You’re tying my hands here, Dave. Using the hacking techniques I learned from Jack is the best option.","Well . . . try the legal methods first before you jump into hacking. But if you do, make certain that it can’t be traced back to us.",When do you need the information?,"The court hearing is three days away. I know that’s pushing you, but we need to get it to the judge before then.","Okay, I’ll have it for you by tomorrow afternoon"
680717__revenge-inc,"Yup, it was me, sweetheart. Goodnight.","He can see you now, Lynn.","Oh, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have barged in like that.","No, it’s all right. Alan Rexford here is Mrs. Claussen’s attorney. He came by to talk about the case. Speaking of which, have you got something for us, Lynn?","Mr. Claussen has an account at Viscount Capital Management that has a current worth of seventy-three million dollars. He has been transferring $3,200 a month to a real estate management firm for a luxury rental at the Ritter Apartments along the river. I did a little digging there and found that the resident in Apartment 875 is a Laura Berkman. She’s been there for the past 16 months.",$73 million? That’s several time his declared assets. He’s trying to shortchange his wife big time. . . . Where did you find this information? We haven’t uncovered any of that.,Well . . . I uh . . .,"Our sources and techniques are proprietary, Al. You understand.","Oh, I didn’t mean to pry, Dave. I was just amazed at what this woman came up with on such short notice. Hang onto her – she’s worth her weight in gold. When can you have a report ready for me, miss.",It’s missus – Missus Jack Preston. I’ll have it typed up within the hour if you want to wait.,"No, have Dave call me when it’s ready and I’ll send over a courier.",Enter.,"Here’s the report Dave, I mean Mr. Cramer.",Everyone calls me Dave. We’re very informal around here. . . . except when it comes to hugging.,"Well you have everything we need to nail Barry Claussen, including the mistresses name and address, which I didn’t expect you to find. I suspect you did a little hacking, but I don’t want to know the details – I need plausible deniability when I testify in court on this case.",Thank you for stepping in before I told Mr. Rexford something I shouldn’t have.,"Even if I thought you came by the information legally, I still would have interrupted. I like to maintain a certain mystique with our clients so they think we’re wired into some master database of everything. It keeps them coming back.","Don’t leave yet. Have a seat. . . . I am just as amazed as Rexford at how quickly and completely you did this, Lynn. I didn’t expect you to be very productive for the first month or two. You clearly have a gift for this kind of work.",It’s Jack’s gift. It just rubbed off on me when we were working together.,"Don’t be modest. You have a real nose for figuring just where to look. I’ll have another case for you tomorrow. Take the rest of the day off – you earned it. And by the way, can you come over for dinner with me and the family Friday night?"
680717__revenge-inc,"I’m so sorry, Lynn. That was really stupid of me to say that. Please accept my apologies.",Apologies accepted. It’s just that any mention of Jack brings back the sadness of loosing him. That’s why I hesitated about accepting your offer for dinner. I was afraid his name would keep coming up.,If we promise not to mention Jack will you come to dinner?,That depends. . . What are you having?
680717__revenge-inc,"Deceased May 12, 2011.",I wonder if her death had anything to do with her affair with the doctor.,"The first email was dated February third and the final one from Hogue, ending the relationship, was dated May eighth – four days before her death! There has to be a connection."
680717__revenge-inc,Oh my gosh. She killed herself because Hogue dumped her. He should go to jail for that. I’ll bet he even wrote the prescription for the pills that killed her.,There it is. And he prescribed it a week before she overdosed. That’s terrible!
680717__revenge-inc,Jaaaack. I need you!,"How could you leave me? You got yourself killed, and now I’ve lost you. Why did you do that to me? I will never leave you, Lynn"
680717__revenge-inc,"Oh Jack, what can I do? How do I get rid of these terrible dreams? It’s like living through it all over again. I can’t stand the pain.","Trust me, sweetheart. These dreams will fade and be replaced with dreams of the great times we had. We weren’t together very long, but we had so many joyful times. Focus on those and the bad memories will lose their grip on you.",Come hold me until I fall asleep.,"You are asleep, Lynn, or else I couldn’t be here. I’ll sit with you for awhile and rub your back. You always liked that."
680717__revenge-inc,"Good morning, sir. How are you today?",You don’t need to be that formal with me.,"Okay Dave, what have you got for me today?",That’s better. This new case will be a little more challenging for you.,"A major company in town has someone near the top embezzling money from them. It shows up because the books don’t balance, but there’s no evidence who the culprit is or how he or she is moving the money out. They want us to find out who it is. Here’s a list of everyone in the company who is high enough in the company to pull this off. See what you can find out about them.","How much are we talking about, Dave?",Almost half a million dollars over the past three years.,"Whoever it is, they will have a secret account somewhere to hide that much money. My first choice would be someone in accounting and finance. They would know how to doctor the books to hide it.","That was my first thought too, but I had my top computer guy, O’Malley, explore that possibility and he came up with nothing. Whoever the embezzler is, he or she seems to be good at covering their tracks.",How soon do you need an answer?,"It may not be when you can find the answer, it may be if you can find the answer. O’Malley is good at cyber crime investigations, so you might find nothing but dead ends.",Let me get back to my office and get started. I’ll send you daily progress updates.,Thanks. I would appreciate that.
680717__revenge-inc,I wonder if I can find other opportunities to get my ‘payback high.’ Maybe I can find other women who have been taken advantage of and help them get revenge. I’ll have to think about that. . . . Oops. There’s my first hit on an opened email.,Personal Finances
680717__revenge-inc,This isn’t good. Now he knows someone is trying to hack him and he’ll hide his activities even deeper. I won’t get another chance going in this way. I need to find another way to get to his records.,It’s getting late. I’ll sleep on it and go after him again in the morning.
680717__revenge-inc,"That’s not the way, Lynn.","Oh, Jack. You haven’t come to visit for the past week and I’ve missed you so much. I need you to get me through these lonely nights.","It’s hopeless, Jack. His computer sensed my presence and shut itself down. He will block me for good now."
680717__revenge-inc,Where is the code? I’ve gone through all the hacking programs you left me and none of them work. And how can you write new code. You only live in my dreams.,"I’m not just your imagination, Lynn. I have ways of doing things. The answer will be waiting for you at the office in the morning."
680717__revenge-inc,"Lynn, you have a visitor waiting in your office.",Jack! What are you doing here! You never show up at the office.,"Would you like some coffee, sir?",You . . . you’re real. I thought you were . . .  were . . .,"I’m Jack’s son, Jackson Junior."
680717__revenge-inc,"You look so much like Jack – a little younger, of course – but you have the same build, the same face, and the same warm blue eyes. It was such a shock to me.","I should have phoned before I came, or at least sent an email, maybe with a photo attached.",What are you doing here? How did you know where to find me?,"Dave called my employer when dad was killed, but I was out of he country and couldn’t return immediately. When I completed my assignment I returned to the states and called Dave to ask about you. When he said you were working here I grabbed the first flight and got in late last night. Dave put me up in a spare bedroom and brought me in to work with him this morning.","Your voice is familiar, where have I heard it?","You called me several months ago when you were looking for the email address of an old high school boyfriend – my father. Jack kept his contact information held closely because of his job with the Agency, but when you searched on his full name, Jackson Joshua Preston, you found me instead.","That’s right. You’re Junior. What do they call you, Jack or Junior?",I go by Jackson. Back in grade school I beat up anyone who called me Junior.,"I remember Jack telling me about that. He was angry at you for fighting, but secretly proud that you could handle yourself in a fight.","Why didn’t you tell me he was coming, Dave. I nearly fainted when I saw him . . . I was sure it was Jack."
680717__revenge-inc,"Take some time off, Lynn, so you two can get acquainted. I know you have been struggling with the Great Eastern investigation. You need a break.",Why don’t you come back to my place. It’s just a couple of blocks away. We can pick up some pastries at the bakery and I’ll make some coffee. I want to hear all about Jack in his younger years.,"That sounds good, Lynn. My stomach is still on Iraq time and I’m hungry."
680717__revenge-inc,"Wow, this place is beautiful. Dave must be paying you big money.","This is the guest suite he uses to keep his clients happy. He’s letting me use it until my own apartment on the floor below is available. Even so, I think he’s paying me more than I’m worth to him.","I doubt that. Dad and I didn’t talk often, but when we did, he bragged about your quick mind and your willingness to jump into action without fear. What has Dave got you doing?","To be truthful, I’m a hacker. I’m not very good at it yet, but Jack taught me enough to investigate financial issues for Dave’s clients. I’m on a case now that has me frustrated. There’s some embezzling going on, and I think I have identified the culprit, but when I tried to sneak Jack’s IP bug into his computer his firewall shut me out. It was like a brick wall. When I tried another of Jack’s invasion programs the computer shut down. Now that he knows I’m trying to break in he’ll throw up new defenses that I don’t have any idea how to penetrate.","Maybe you should go around the brick wall, not through it.",What did you just say?,I said that maybe you should go around the brick wall. Hack into the corporate accounting computer files and find how he’s siphoning off the money.,What’s wrong? Did I say something that upset you?,"N . . . No. It’s just that last night, J . . . someone else told me the same thing in my dream.",That’s amazing. You must be clairvoyant or something.,How do I get into Great Eastern’s accounting system and locate the leak?,That’s easy. I can write you a few lines of code that will solve that problem.,Lets have some Danish and coffee and maybe you can start on that.,"Wow, that’s the Rolls Royce of laptops. No, it’s the Lamborghini of laptops. There couldn’t be more than a couple of dozen in existence. Did Jack get this for you?",Yeah. He got one the entire team – the Forseti group – when we were trying to keep Winston out of the White House.,That’s a story you’ll have to tell me sometime. Jack was very secretive about what he was doing.,He had good reason to be. Our lives were on the line constantly.,"Okay, let’s get started. Show me the Great Eastern web site."
680717__revenge-inc,"Well, now we know where the money is going so let’s find out who is sending it there.","There you have it, Lynn. You were right; the money is going to an account in the name of George Henry Davidson.","Wow you’re good. I wish I could create my own hacking and spy software. I’m a pretty decent hacker using the tools Jack developed, but I don’t know how to write my own code for specific tasks like this.",There are places you can go for a crash course in writing this kind of computer code. Ask Dave to send you to one of them. For now though why don’t you email this information about the embezzler to Dave so he can turn it over to the company lawyers.,Tell me about your relationship with Jack as you were growing up. Was he a good dad?,"Dad was away on business a lot. His job at the Agency took him all over the world. But when he was home we spent a lot of time together. He taught me sports, computers, electronics, and self-defense – and he made sure I was better than him at all of them. That background has been invaluable in my job.","If you don’t mind me asking, what is your job?",If I told you I’d have to shoot you. That’s what dad always said about his job.,So you followed him into the family business – a secret agent man?,"Yes, but my work is a little different. I’m an expert in covert surveillance for a three-letter Government agency that must remain nameless. We use everything from eyes-on stalking, to hidden cameras, to satellite imaging to find out who’s doing things they don’t want us to know about. Our recent work has been focused on tracking middle eastern terrorists so our drones can neutralize them.","That sounds more exciting than what Jack said he did before he retired. Actually, I think he got involved in a lot more exciting things after retirement. We were being chased around the country by some Russian thugs who were following Charles Winston’s orders to shut us up any way they could. That was definitely the most exciting time of my life. I kind of miss it now.",Tell me about Jack’s first wife – your mother.,"She was an angel. She knew her role was to support Jack in every way she could. She ran the household, raised me, did the family accounting, and welcomed Jack home with loving arms whenever he returned from an assignment. The only cross words I ever heard between them was about treatment for her cancer. Jack wanted her to get chemo and radiation, even though it would only prolong her life for a few months. She told him that it was her life and she would die the way she chose to, without the misery of useless treatments. When she died dad wrapped his arms around me and bawled like a baby. It was the only time I ever saw him cry. . .","He cried with me sometimes, especially when he talked about Helen’s death and his depression. He said he wasn’t able to cry for most of his life, until God  opened up his heart. I guess most men are like that. How about you Jackson. Can you cry?",Not often . . . it has to be a really powerful feeling to make me cry.,"Work on that, will you? Your wife and family will love you for it.",I’m not married. With all the travel my job requires I didn’t think it would be fair.,"I have a close woman friend that I spend time with when I’m back in states, but we each have our own lives and priorities.  That makes our limited time together more enjoyable.","That sounds like my relationship with Jack. We were two married people living together, but with no claim on each others’ time. It was wonderful.",I’m happy to hear that his life ended in so much happiness. After Mom died I didn’t think he could ever be happy again.,What powerful feelings make you cry?,"It was at a restaurant with Louise, my woman friend. The Italian restaurant was one of those with a singing waiter who, on this particular night, was an older retired opera singer. The date was September 11th, 2001. The country was in shock after the terrorist airliner attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. The restaurant was only half full because so many were still in shock. At 8:30 the waiters passed out candles and a pack of matches for each diner. 8:46, exactly  twelve hours after the first plane crashed into the North Tower, the old gentleman stood on a chair, asked everyone to light their candles, then sang the most moving rendition of God Bless America I have ever heard. Everyone in the restaurant was crying after that. I still choke up whenever I talk about it.","Wow. That’s a reason to cry if I ever heard one, Jackson. You’ve got me crying about it."
680717__revenge-inc,Here she is,"Come on up front, Lynn, and meet the management staff of Great Eastern Financial Holdings. Lynn is the brain behind our success at catching your embezzler. Not only that, she identified the dates and amounts of each theft and found the number of the off-shore bank account where Mr. Davidson sent the money. Based on her work, Davidson has been indicted in Federal court for international embezzlement and failure to pay income taxes. Once the evidence against him was revealed, he confessed to everything, which will allow your lawyers to transfer the funds back to your corporation.","How much are you paying her, David? Whatever it is I’ll double it if she will come and work for us.","Solving this case was a team effort, Mr. McCoy. I simply provided the key to unlock his secret account. If I went to work for Great Eastern you would only get a small piece of the package that brought Davidson down.",Well said Ms. Preston.,"It looks like the only way we can stay connected to your team is to keep you on permanent contract to us, if that’s acceptable to you.","It certainly is acceptable, Avery. I’ll have my people get together with your people and draw up a contract.","Let’s get going on that right away, then. I want your accounting investigators to provide full time monitoring of our funds movement.",Come into my office. Let’s talk about your next assignment.,"I have a job that could be dangerous, Lynn. It’s an undercover job with a defense contractor, U. S. Munitions. I would prefer to send one of my seasoned male agents, but the position available doesn’t fit with any of their capabilities. Whether I send you in is a decision that you need to be part of.","I’m up for it, Dave. Tell me about it.","Okay. The factory is located in Wilmington, Delaware. It manufactures assorted munitions for the Army, but everything that shows up on the shipping manifest doesn’t make it to the Army ammunitions depots. Some of the inventory is being diverted to another destination. The Army wants us to find out who’s involved at the munitions factory and where it’s being diverted to. Once we get that for them, they’ll take over and trace it to the end recipient, which is probably ISIS terrorists. At that point they’ll roll up the entire supply chain with arrests.",Holy sh . . . Are you serious! I would love to be part of this operation. What will I do?,"There’s a job opening in their inventory tracking department. It’s mostly computer work, but it will put you in a position to keep your eyes and ears on the operation and  look for the illegal shipments. The one thing that makes me hesitate in giving you this assignment is the possibility that you will be found out – that the bad guys will figure out that you’re after them. Given the money involved in these illegal shipments, they could have you killed if they figure out what you’re doing.",You know me Dave. You’ve seen me in action against Winston’s men. I’m good at playing a role and good with a gun.,Whoa. Who said anything about guns. If it were that dangerous I wouldn’t be sending you.,Your men carry guns on some of their operations. I just wanted to remind you that I can handle myself.,Consider me reminded. I’ll have someone keeping an eye on you in case you need help. He will be up here in a couple of minutes to brief you on the operation.,Who is it?,A friend of yours from the Forseti team – Tom Gutierrez.,That’s great. I would trust Tom with my life any day. He saved my butt a couple of times back then.,While we’re waiting for him Margaret told me to remind you about dinner at our place tonight. Once you go undercover your only contact with us will be through Tom. Tom and Jackson will join us tonight.,I heard my name. What were you telling her about me?,"It’s great to see you, Tom. Dave just told me you’ll be backing me up on this new case.","I think you will like this operation, Lynn. You have the perfect skill set for going undercover at U. S. Munitions without suspicion.","Okay, tell me about it.","Dave gave you some background on what we’re looking for. We need to find out who is diverting shipments of RP7 rocket propelled grenades and how they are getting them out of the plant undetected. The Army put a tail some of the loaded trucks to see if they stop to unload part of the shipment on route to the depot, but they haven’t uncovered anything so far. Their current theory is that the full shipments never leave the plant – that somehow they’re smuggling product directly out of the factory. The position you will fill as inventory tracking analyst will give you the authority and a reason to show up at the shipping docks at anytime. While you’re there checking shipping procedures and documentation you can look around and see if you can find anything suspicious going on. But you can’t spend too much time down or it might tip them off that you’re a company spy.",Whoopee! I always told Jack that I loved the spy stuff and now I get to be one. When do I go in?,"We’ve already created a new identity for you and rented a cheap apartment near the plant. You will have a car with registration to match your identity. The company created paperwork to show that you just transferred from their Pittsburgh facility. You and I will fly out there this afternoon so you can get familiar with the job and be able to talk about the layout if anyone asks you. Tomorrow I’ll drill you on your background as your fake identity, Cynthia Carson – where you grew up, went to school, that sort of thing. You will start the new job on Monday. Here’s the information so you can start studying it. We . . . we uh . . . made you a widow. Your husband died of a heart attack six months ago and you’re still grieving, so that will give you a reason to avoid talking about your family life.",I won’t be doing any acting to play that part. Just your comments about a fictitious husband’s death set me off.,"I’m sorry, Lynn. I didn’t mean to upset you, but that cover story will be easy for you to remember.","It’s my problem, Tom, not yours. I’m slowly leaving it behind me.",Okay.  We’ve got a two o’clock flight to Pittsburgh to catch. We’ll be coming back later this afternoon so you don’t have to pack anything.
680717__revenge-inc,in the middle of Hatfield and McCoy country,"How is your life going, Tom. I remember your wife divorced you after one of your daughters was kidnapped by Winston’s Russian thugs. Have you moved on from that?","I was pretty depressed after that and tried to drink my pain away, but with God’s help I left that behind. Mary tried to get sole custody of the girls but the lawyers Dave got me connected with put a stop to that. I get them one weekend a month, which is the highlight of my life – and theirs. Mary is incapable of loving them, but I try to make up for that whenever they’re with me.","Have you remarried, Tom?","No, I don’t want to complicate my relationship with the girls. Once they’re away from Mary and in college I may start dating again.",Don’t you get lonely living by yourself?,"Not at all. After all those years under Mary’s control and anger, it’s refreshing to be free.","I’m happy for you, Tom.","Dave, Lynn has talked to me about what she sees as her inadequacy in writing new hacking code. She got the breakthrough on the Great Eastern job because I stepped in and provided what she needed. I think your firm would benefit from improving her capabilities in software development.","You have a good point, Jackson. How can we remedy that?","There’s a school in New York City called The Recurse Center – it used to be called the Hacker School until they chose a more politically correct name – that offers a six-week course in computer code development for hacking. It’s sort of a hacker’s boot  camp. The tuition is $12,000, and the dormitory housing is another $2,000, but with the what she already knows, she will come out of it with skills beyond what most hackers can offer. I think you should send her there after the undercover assignment is over, Dave.","Please say yes, Dave. I want to get as good at this as Jack was.","I like the idea, Lynn. I’ll have the accounting department set it up for the next time the course begins. But tell me about your visit to U.S. Munitions in Pittsburgh?",It was great. I’ll be able to step right into the job at the Wilmington plant. Tom equipped me with a special cell phone that will stream live audio and video back to the Cramer Security communications center whenever I key in a three number code. That way you will be able to record what I see and hear my conversations with others. It has a very stylish belt holster so I can clip the phone on the front of my belt or my purse so it will provide a good video image and sound.,Good. It sounds like you’re all set.,Tom helped me move my clothes into an ancient apartment complex near the plant. The refrigerator and freezer are well stocked and there’s an old laptop on the desk with souped up software so I can do my internet research at the apartment.,What about transportation?,"Tom fixed me up with a twelve year old Mazda Miata convertible. It looks old but the engine is in great shape . . . in case I have to outrun the cops or something I’ll drive it to the apartment tonight and begin my life as Cynthia Carson, free spirited widow, inventory analyst, and corporate spy extraordinaire. I’ll start work first thing Monday morning."
680717__revenge-inc,Hi. I’m Warren Ziggler. You must be Cynthia Carson.,"Please, call me Cindy.",Okay Cindy. I see from your records that you have done this job before – at our Pittsburgh plant.,"Nancy has been filling in until you could get here, so I’ll have her walk you through the daily grind. Nancy, come meet your replacement, Cindy.","Hi Cindy. I’m so glad you’re here. Computers are not my strong suit, so I’ve been struggling to keep up. I’m way behind on my inspections, so why don’t we go down to the shipping dock and start there.",Great. What do I need to take with me?,I just ran off this inventory printout. That and my clipboard are all we need.,Does this thing every break down?,It stalls between floors now and then but they usually get it running after a few minutes. Sometimes I welcome the break . . . at least when there’s no one on it with me.,Who else uses this elevator?,"Oh, some of the guys from the shipping floor . . . Mostly it’s Jake, the dock foreman.",Can I meet him this morning?,Definitely. He’s the one who signs off on the shipping bills of lading. When your inventory numbers don’t match up with his shipping documents there’s big trouble.,When happens then?,Uh . . . we discuss it and he ends up having his way.,Is that the way things are supposed to work?,"No. I’m supposed to climb onto the loaded trucks and do a count with him, but I don’t like to do that.",Why is that?,He . . . he scares me.,Is that all he does?,N . . . I don’t want to talk about it. He’s coming over here.,"Well, this must be our new inventory gal. What were you two been talking about?",Hi. I’m Cynthia Carson. And you are?,I’m Jake Dillon. They call be Big Jake.,"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dillon. And what is your responsibility here on the shipping floor?","I’m in charge down here, Ms. . . . Cynthia. I control everything that goes in or goes out of the factory. Nothing moves without my signature. If something should happen to delay a shipment, then whoever is responsible answers to me.","Well, as long as everything on my inventory shows up in the right truck, you won’t get any trouble from me, Mr. Dillon.","You aren’t going to make trouble for me, are you missy. Nancy and me worked real good together and I expect the same from you.","We’ll see Mr. Dillon, we’ll see.","You shouldn’t have said that, Cindy. You don’t know what he’s capable of.","I can handle myself, Nancy. Lets get you upstairs and back to your regular job so you won’t have to deal with ‘Big Jake’ anymore."
680717__revenge-inc,"Excuse me, gentlemen, but I have an important announcement. Under the authority of the Inventory Division Manager, there will be a change in policy regarding inspection of outgoing shipments. No truck will leave this facility until I have personally gone through the truck and checked each item against the bill of lading. Mr. Dillon will accompany me as I inspect each shipment. I have a list of all shipments going out today and the scheduled departure time. I will be at the dock fifteen minutes before each departure time to inspect the load. If everything checks out the truck will be closed up and released to the driver. If there is a discrepancy between my inventory count and the shipping bill, the truck will be unloaded and reloaded under my supervision.  Are there any questions?","You can’t do this missy! I’m in charge down here and I won’t allow it. It will screw up the entire shipping schedule, and throw all of the deliveries behind.",If there are problems we will make adjustments to resolve them. If you have a complaint why don’t you and I go up the Division Manager and discuss it right now.,"You heard the lady, men. Let’s get these trucks loaded."
680717__revenge-inc,Is this truck ready for inspection now Mr. Dillon?,"It sure is. Let’s climb in and have a look. Shipping docks are very dangerous places, missy. Serious accidents can happen that could cripple or kill a careless person – especially a greenhorn like you.","Is that a threat, Mr. Dillon?","Take it any way you want to, dearie."
680717__revenge-inc,If you want to grab a drink with me somewhere I’ll give you a blow-by-blow account.,"I would like that, but I have to be really careful. If Jake or one of his crew saw us talking we could both be in danger. I know a place a few miles from here where none of the workers go.","Great, Nancy. I see you then."
680717__revenge-inc,"I was worried you wouldn’t come, Cindy. I thought maybe some . . . something happened to you.","I appreciate your concern, but I can take care of myself, even against Big Jake.",You don’t have any idea how violent he can be. That’s why I agreed to meet you – to warn you about what could happen to you. Jake is not one to mess with.,"What has he done to you, Nancy?",Nothing. He hasn’t done anything to me.,"I hear your voice telling me one thing, but your eyes and your demeanor are telling me a different story. You can share your fear and pain with me, Nancy. I’ll never tell a soul.","Okay Cindy. I’ll tell you what he’s done to me. But only so you can realize how cruel and powerful he is. . . . When I first started as a temporary replacement for Jeanie, the last inventory analyst, I had no idea what I was in for. I should have suspected something – Jeanie had to quit because she was attacked, beaten, and raped in her home. She didn’t report it to the police because she was afraid the attacker would return to kill her. Looking back at what I know now, I believe it was Big Jake who broke in and was waiting for her when she got home from work.",Why would Jake take a risk like that? Couldn’t Jeanie identify him as her attacker and have him put in Jail?,"I talked to Jeanie after the attack and she claimed the rapist was wearing a mask so she couldn’t tell who he was, but I think she was lying to me. I think she was too afraid of another visit from Jake, so she resigned from the company.","Why would Jake Dillon do that to her, Nancy?"
680717__revenge-inc,"What happened next, Nancy?","He . . . he put his hand over my mouth and whispered in my ear that if I tried to scream he would kill me. I was terrified! Then he pushed his body up against me and grabbed my . . . my breasts. He asked  ‘Have you ever been raped, Nancy? It can be very pleasurable, or very painful. I can make it whatever you want.’ I begged him to let me go. He forced a kiss on my lips. It was all I could do not the throw up. Then he stepped back, looked me up down, and told me that, unless I ignored the inventory discrepancies, he would finish what he had started.","Oh my gosh, Nancy! What happened to you was terrible. Did you report him?","No. He said that if I said anything something even worse would happen to me. After that, I never went into a truck to check the inventory. I just accepted his version of the shipping documents and signed off on them.",Did he ever do anything else to you?,"He would slip onto the freight elevator at the end of a shift now and then and feel me up, just to keep me in line I guess. I couldn’t wait to get home and into the shower to scrub his filth off me.",He’ll be sorry if he tries anything like that with me. I won’t be afraid to report him.,"You don’t understand, Cindy. If you get in the way of his secret operation he could kill you!",My husband . . . before he died . . . taught me how to take care of myself. I know a few moves that will make him wish he hadn’t messed with me.,"I wish I had your skills, and your confidence. I always let men run over me because I’m afraid of them. My father used to beat me when I was little. He would come home drunk, smack my mother around, then start on me. When I started developing as a woman I had to run away because I knew what was coming next. I lived with an aunt until I finished high school then ran off with my first husband – who turned out to be just like my father. After he put me in the hospital twice I filed for divorce. He came to the restaurant where I was working and yelled that he would kill me before he let me go. That and the beatings were enough to get him some jail time. I was scared that when he got out he would come after me, but his temper solved that problem. He got in a fight with another inmate and was stabbed to death.",How did you get your job at U. S. Munitions?,"I took some accounting courses at the community college. That’s where I met my second husband. I thought he was such a sweet guy, but that changed as soon as we were married. He expected me to be the perfect wife and homemaker – hot dinner  on the table the minute he got home, not a speck of dust or dirt anywhere, waiting on him hand and foot, and ready to please him in bed every night no matter how tired I was. And if anything displeased him, he would whip me with his belt.",How awful! Are you still married to him?,No. After several months of that I went on strike and did nothing for him. He got tired of whipping me and divorced me. I feel sorry for whoever he gets to replace me.,"No wonder Big Jake intimidates you so, after how the men in your life have treated you. Your first husband got what was coming to him, but do you ever think about getting even with the second one?",Oh yes. I spend a lot of time thinking up ways to get revenge – very prolonged and painful ways mostly. But it’s just fantasy.,"It doesn’t have to be. I might be able to help you with that. Not right now, but we can talk about this again in a few weeks. I’ll give you my personal phone number.","Now you have me curious, Cindy. Are there some hidden things about you that I need to know?",That’s a topic for another time. I need to get back to my place and get some rest. This first day on the job was a little stressful.,"Well, thanks for listening to me. I needed to get some of that off my chest.","Anytime I can help, let me know."
680717__revenge-inc,You have eleven trucks scheduled for departure today. How do you plan to get them all loaded and inspected in eight hours?,"Oh, my boys will get them loaded. I had a talk with them and they agreed to step up their efforts to make sure we finish. My question is how do you plan to get them all inspected? If you hold them up, the drivers get overtime pay and management won’t be happy about that. I suppose we’ll just have to spot check some of them and you can just sign off on the others so they get out of here on time.","Listen up! We have to load and inspect eleven trucks today. I understand that Mr. Dillon has asked you to work hard enough to get it done and you have graciously agreed. But to avoid a bottleneck with inspections, we will have to change the loading procedure. I want each truck’s load to be stacked on the loading dock behind the truck, with the shipping labels all facing to the right. When the crates are ready to be put in the truck, let me know and Mr. Dillon and I will rush over, complete the inventory, and sign off on it. As soon as that’s done, I want a double crew available to load it immediately while I watch. Any questions?","How about you, Mr. Dillon? Any questions? You heard the lady - get to work!"
680717__revenge-inc,"You might have to roll up your sleeves and do some actual loading work to stay on schedule, Mr. Dillon.","This isn’t over, missy. I’ll have a union representative in here tomorrow to see how you order my men around. By union rules, I’m the only one who can do that.",Then maybe I’ll have to join your union myself so I can play by your rules.
680717__revenge-inc,"That was a good day’s work, Mr. Dillon. Who would have thought your crew could get eleven trucks out in a single day.","They can do that any day, missy – at least until some of them start calling in sick."
680717__revenge-inc,"This is the absolute best time of my day, Margaret. It’s why I can put up with all the oversized egos, anger, and demands of my clients. Sometimes I wish it was still just you and me running the smallest detective agency in Philly. We worked long hours, but the clientele we dealt with were everyday folks who needed a little help with simple problems. Now I have to deal with corporate CEOs who think they know everything and never miss a chance to blow their own horns. And the staff members they bring along to witness their greatness – most of these know their boss is a buffoon – but they have to agree with him on everything or they’re fired. My staff members know to question everything – to let me know when I’m like the King With New Clothes from Hans Christian Anderson’s tales.",That’s called the Emperor’s New Clothes dear.,Just like I said. I surround myself with people who aren’t afraid to correct me.
680717__revenge-inc,"Damn! Just when it was getting interesting. Hello, Dave here. This better be important.","It’s O’Malley, Dave. There’s a problem with Lynn’s assignment.",I’m headed for the car. Fill me in on the way.,"Can you give me a rain check on that, sweetheart? I shouldn’t be too long.","I’ll be ready and waiting whenever you get home, dear. I’ll wear that black satin negligee. Maybe it will entice you to get home sooner.","Torture me, why don’t you. I’ll be back as soon as I can. I hope that will keep you warm until I get back."
680717__revenge-inc,"Tell me what happened It’s best if you see it yourself, Dave. I’ll play the video for you.",If you call a sickout won’t that limit the number of trucks that can be loaded and released for departure?,"It sure will, missy, but I’ll tell management – and the union – that it was your fault because you increased the workload today. The union contract says we don’t have to load more than seven trucks a day, but you told us we had to do eleven trucks – eleven trucks in an eight-hour day. If the crew had worked at it’s usual pace, they’d have got time and a half for the extra time it would’a took.","If you go to management, they will ask why your men can’t do eleven trucks every day. The fact that they did eleven today is proof that they’re slacking off most of the time – purposely working slowly so they can have time to B.S. with each other – and for moving some of the crates to your hiding place for off-the-books shipping to other customers.","You shouldn’t have said that, Lynn. You just gave away your cover.",But only to Jake. If we can get him out of the picture we still might be able to see how the shipments are getting out.,"I may have solved that problem, at least in the short term. Watch the rest of the video.",What do you know about that! Are you a cop? I’ll show you how we handle cops around here – especially woman cops.
680717__revenge-inc,YES!,We can edit out that last part – it wouldn’t play well in front of a jury.,"Our goal here was to uncover a link to the RPG munitions smuggling, not to get payback on a Neanderthal dock loading chief. I see that you had to defend yourself, Lynn, but it’s almost like you wanted him to attack you just so you could unleash your anger on him. You revealed your undercover mission with your comment about off-the-books shipping. Now he thinks you are a cop. If that information gets back to the dock workers or the union, you’ll be lucky to get out alive. I think we have to terminate the operation for your protection, Lynn.","So far, Jake is the only one who suspects Lynn, and he’s in the hospital with his jaw wired shut and drugged to the gills. If Lynn can get back in there tomorrow and figure out how the illegal shipments are getting out, before Jake has a chance to communicate what he knows, it might work out. But tomorrow will have to be her last day. If she can’t crack the case by close of business we have to pull her out.","Let me do this Dave. I’ve figured out how Jake was short-loading some of the trucks. Now I just have to find where he stashes the stolen crates and gets them out of the factory. . . . Please, Dave, let me finish this.","Well, it’s against my better judgment, but I’ll give you one more day. Tom, you park your car at the diner across the street from the employees’ gate in case you have to get to her quickly. And I’ll post a couple of my guys staking out her apartment in case Jake gets the word out somehow. I’m going home. I have something special waiting for me there."
680717__revenge-inc,Lynn! Lynn? Are you all right?,"I’m in here, Tom. I’m okay.  Where were you? Sleeping in your car?","I had to step into the alley to take a leak. I didn’t know they were here until I saw them running out your door. I was too far away to stop them, but I got a license number. What did they do in here?",I slid under the bed with my gun and listened while one of them put two shots from a silenced hand gun into my pillow.,Did they see you?,No. I resisted the urge to cripple them both by blowing away their ankles.,"What do we do now, Tom?","Well, if they think they killed you, they won’t expect you to show up at work tomorrow. Maybe you could go in late, after they have pulled some crates from a shipment or two and hidden them away. Then you show up and announce an inventory of the trucks. They’ll have to send someone to sneak the diverted crates back to the loading dock. Meanwhile I’ll be wandering around as a janitor to see where they go to recover the hidden shipping containers.","I like that plan, Tom. And by looking to see who is the most surprised at my re-appearance, I might figure out who came over for the midnight visit.","Listen up, everybody. Is this everyone? Where is Mr. Dillon this morning?",He didn’t show up today. He must be sick or something.,Aren’t we missing two forklift drivers? Where are they? Hey. Over here. We’re having a meeting.
680717__revenge-inc,"I said we’re having a meeting. Now get off your vehicles and join the rest of us. I got held up in traffic today so I got here late. I see you have already started loading the trucks without my inspection, so I want no more crates loaded until I have time to inspect what’s on the trucks already. You can continue to stack the crates behind each truck like you did yesterday until I can get to them. Who is going to sign the shipping documents – who is Mr. Dillon’s replacement when he’s absent?","Okay, I have to go upstairs and print out the inventory list for today’s shipments. I’ll be back in thirty minutes, then you join me for the inspections."
680717__revenge-inc,"All done here. Good work! You should leave now, but don’t go back to the undercover apartment. I’ll meet you back at CSIC.",Hi Cindy. I hear you’re doing a great job down in shipping.,That’s what I want to talk to you about. I’ll be leaving the factory in a few minutes and you will get a call telling you to take over for me.,Are you going home sick or something?,"Yeah, or something. But I won’t be back, so the job will be yours if you want it.",I can’t do the job right as long a Big Jake is around.,"He won’t be a problem, Nancy, not today – not ever.","Seriously! What did you do, get him fired?","No, but it won’t be long before you know the story. I have really enjoyed our friendship. If you ever need any help – with abusive men I mean, call me.","So this is goodbye, huh. Thank you.","I wish I could keep this car. It fits me like a glove. It’s a little noisy with the convertible top up or down, but with stereo speakers in the headrest, I can still listen to my favorite music – oldies from when I was growing up. I wish I could keep it, but the company paid for it, so it has to go back for resale. It’s worth almost $3,000. New upholstery and a paint job would add another thousand. It’s in great shape mechanically with not too much mileage on it. The new upholstery and a paint job and it will like new. I think I’ll ask Dave if I can buy it from CSIC."
680717__revenge-inc,"Your instincts on this operation were right on, Lynn. The Army has people watching the Machine Tools, Inc. warehouse –the company van that Dillon used to ship out the stolen crates. At the army’s request U. S. Munitions shipped out a truckload of RPGs without explosive warheads with no inventory inspection. The forklift drivers diverted three of the crates to the van, which transported them to Machine Tools. The crates had GPS trackers planted in them so the Army can track them all the way to the final destination. Once they have the entire chain identified they will roll it up, with arrests all the way back to the U. S. Munitions forklift drivers and Jake Dillon. Those guys will spend a long time in prison. If the stolen RPGs ended up is the hands of ISIS or Al Qaeda they could be tried for treason with a possible death sentence.","I don’t think a death sentence for Jake and the forklift drivers is warranted – they were just greedy men trying to make a buck. But if some of those  munitions were used to kill American soldiers, then they should get whatever is coming to them.","I agree with you on that issue, Lynn. Whatever happens to them, you did a superb job on this and I would like to give you this bonus check as a reward for boosting the reputation of my company.","Four thousand dollars is too much, Dave. I can’t accept it. But if you were to offer me the Miata undercover car, I would gladly accept it.","Consider it done. I’ll let accounting know and have the title transferred to you. Now, about your immediate future. Jackson pulled some strings and got you into the next session of the hacking school in New York City. The school offers housing for out of town students, so we booked a room for you for the six-week term. It starts a week from Monday. Until then I want you to take some time off, with pay. Go somewhere where you can depressurize."
680717__revenge-inc,"I need a pep talk, Harriet. I got drunk again last night and I liked it – the escape from the pain. I need a friend to lean on, to help me get through this pain rather than wallow in it.","Oh, honey, I’ll do anything to help you through this. I can be up there by noon and we can talk.","I just had an idea, Harriet. Do you like riding in a sports convertible with the top down?",As long as it isn’t raining.,Do you feel like a cross-country trip in a Mazda Miata with me? We can pretend to be Thelma and Louise.,Do I get to be Louise?,"Whatever works for you, dear. But we won’t drive over a cliff at the end.",Not unless we kill someone on the road.
680717__revenge-inc,"There might be some winter weather coming in tomorrow afternoon, Harriet, so we should get an early start.",Where are we staying in Telluride?,This late in the season there should be several ski lodges with rooms available. I’ll check online and get some reservations. What are you coming up with on your laptop.,"I spend a lot of time on crime websites – learning what I can about interesting cases that stump the police. Occasionally I find something they missed, so I send them an email to get them back on track.",Anything interesting happening now?,There was a murder in a Philly hospital. Someone sneaked into the room of a guy named Dillon and smothered him with a pillow. Not much detail on the victim – and no leads on a suspect.,What! Was it Jake Dillon? He’s the one at U. S. Munitions who was smuggling RPVs out of  the factory. I put him in the hospital when he tried to make a move on me. It looks like the people he was working for don’t want him to talk.
680717__revenge-inc,"Wow, what a fun life you’re living, Lynn. I didn’t have that much action when I was with the Agency.","I hope Dave can keep interesting cases coming for me, especially if they involve computer hacking. . . . Oh, did I tell you? Dave is sending me to a hacker boot camp when we get back. It’s a place in New York City called The Recurse Center that runs a six-week course in programming for hackers. It gets its name from one of a programmer’s important tools – recursion. It’s when a program zeros in on solution by repeatedly applying an procedure. It’s one of a hackers main tools.","That sounds terrific, Lynn, but are you sure you will be okay all alone there? If you want I can come with you.","I think I’ll be all right, especially if this trip give me the catharsis I hope it does.","Well, you know where to find me if you need someone.",We better get some sleep.  We should leave here no later than eight o’clock. See you in the morning.
680717__revenge-inc,"This is a pretty classy place, Lynn, with lots of guests. How did you get us into a room?","I know the manager, Carole. She and I used to ski together when I lived here. She gave us the best suite in the house.",Wow. You were right about that. What’s this place costing us?,"Not that it matters, but Carole said everything is on the house. I told her that was unacceptable, and she said ‘Then you can’t stay here. You and Jack were two of my closest friends. It’s the least that I can do for you.’ So I gave in."
680717__revenge-inc,I’m sorry I agreed to let you come here. I can see the memories are just too painful.,"No, these aren’t tears of pain, Harriet. They’re tears of joy for the wonderful memories that were released. I felt the pain lifted from me – I’m at peace, at least for  now. Thank you for bringing me here.","It’s time to head back. These spring snowstorms can dump a lot of wet, heavy snow in a very short time."
680717__revenge-inc,I think we’re lost. Even at this slower pace we should be there already. If we keep going we’ll just get further from the hotel. And we can’t stay here very long because we’ll get too cold to move.,We can’t even call the lodge and ask for help without phone service. The snow is probably interfering with the signal. If it lets up we should be able to get through.,"Don’t count on it. Cell reception has always been erratic here on the mountain. We need to make a fire, but I don’t have any matches. Do you?","No, I don’t have anything that could light a fire. There are plenty of dry dead branches under the tree here, but no way to get them burning. Do you know how to rub two sticks together?","No, I missed that lesson when I was a Girl Scout. Let me think . . . something is trying to bubble up in my mind.","Yes, yes, that’s it. Now I remember. Thank you Jack.",So we’re going to use something Jack taught you to build our fire?,"Yes, and he just reminded me of it. Pile up lots of small sticks, while I take the battery out of my cell phone."
680717__revenge-inc,"Yesss! I’ll call the hotel and give them our coordinates. No, no! This is not a hoax. I’m telling you the truth. They hung up on me!","Here give me the phone. This is Lynn Preston. I want to speak to Carole Cunningham immediately. I’m a close personal friend of hers. . . . Hi Carole, it’s Lynn. My friend and I are in a bit of a fix and need your help . . .","Knock, knock. Is anybody home?"
680717__revenge-inc,We used our snowmobiles.,Why didn’t we hear the motors as you approached? Snowmobiles are noisy.,"Because these are electric snowmobiles made by the Sierra Snow Company – ultra light weight, seating for two, and whisper quiet.",How do you know about that? These have only been on the market for the past six months.,I . . . uh . . . I had an occasion to use one recently.
680717__revenge-inc,Let’s get you girls back to the lodge and in front of a warm fire.,These are pretty pricey vehicles. Why did you choose them?,Telluride has a new noise abatement law that will phase out gasoline models before next winter. With all the tourists buzzing around the area in rented snowmobiles it gets pretty noisy.,What will the rental businesses do? They won’t be able to afford to switch to electric models.,One of them has already closed down for good. The other two are trying to sell off their gasoline models to get some cash for the new electrics.,"The environmentalists will own the country some day, then  . . . look out for your personal freedom."
680717__revenge-inc,I hope this little adventure didn’t ruin your vacation.,"No, it’s given me exactly what I came for – peace about losing Jack. My mind is flooded with good memories about our time together. Now I can move on with my life.","Speaking of moving on, when are we going back?","As much as I love this place, I think we should leave tomorrow. We have a two-day drive ahead of us, and I want to spend a night or two at Jack’s place in West Virginia before I go back to work. If you don’t want to stay gone that long you could have Rick drive there and pick you up.",I think I’ll do that. We’ve only been gone a few days but I miss him already.,"Bob and Carole, thanks for you hospitality – and the rescue. I lived out here for several years and should know better than to go out when a snow storm is coming. Harriet, let’s go up and pack our luggage so we can get out of here at first light."
680717__revenge-inc,"How is the gang coming with finding us some get-away cars, Nita?",They’re going to L.A. Sunday to steal the cars from a used car dealers around town. I told them to stick with popular older models so we won’t stand out in the traffic. I don’t want to be on the six o’clock news being chased by cop cars and a helicopter like O. J. They will drive the cars straight to the warehouse in Chowchilla and have them ready to go Monday morning.,"They know what we want in the car trunks, don’t they?","Great. How about those documents, Alice? Will your brother make them for us?","Yes, but he wants to get paid for it. He’s the best forger on the west coast so he wants top dollar – $1,000 for each set. He’s working on them now – driver’s licenses, car registrations, and credit cards. He hacked into the prison records to get photos of each of us.",Yuck. That’s the worst picture of me ever. I don’t want that on my driver’s license.,Don’t worry Shakira. He’ll run them through his Photoshop software to make us look like movie stars.,Then I want to be Jennifer Aniston.,Hasn’t anyone told you? You’re black.,"Yeah, but I could be a black Jennifer.","Enough of the chatter, girls. Alice, tell your brother I’ll make a call and have someone pick up the documents Sunday morning. He will have $4,000 cash to give him. ‘Nita, the same goes for your guys with the money they will put in the car trunks. Tell me where you want it delivered and I’ll take care of it.","Where you gonna get money like that, girl?",I have it stashed inside my mattress back in the cell.,"You lyin’ to me, Z",Careful who you call a liar. I’ve killed people for less than that.,"I’m sorry, ma’am. I didn’t mean it. I was just kiddin’ around.","I’ll let it slide this time, but don’t do it again.","Yes, ma’am.","Okay, that’s our plan. Any questions.?",What about all the cop cars that will be looking for us. If we don’t get out of the area quickly they will have road blocks up.,"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some people I know on the outside are going to stage a huge traffic accident involving a semi and as many other vehicles as he can mow down before he runs into a ditch. It will be on Highway 52, about five miles west of town, to draw all law enforcement vehicles out that way. They’ll be tied up with that for at least an hour while we drive south towards Fresno.",Exercise period is over. Line up at the door for an inmate count.
680717__revenge-inc,"How long have you been sitting here, honey?",A couple of hours. I hoped you two might arrive early and I was anxious to see you. Driving a little car like that over these roads is dangerous; a coal truck coming around a bend in the wrong lane would squash it like a bug.,You didn’t need to worry. Lynn handles the Miata like a race driver.,"I know she’s a good driver, but I was afraid she might let you drive.","Enough of your misogynist jokes, buster.",Are you ready to head back to The Farm.,"How about if we stay here over night and leave in the morning? Is that okay with you, Lynn.",That would be great. We can talk about the adventures we shared here when Winston sent Alexei to shut us up.,"Don’t you worry about someone breaking into the cabin while you’re away, Lynn?",You must be reading my mind. I was just thinking the same thing.,"I remember that Jack installed a state-of-the-art security system in the house and around the property. If anyone was prowling around, his system would send a warning to his computer immediately and give him a live video feed. Can you reactivate that?","I suppose I should. Jack kept everything on a computer system hidden in the basement. After we finish our coffee, let’s go down and see if it can tell us how to get things working again."
680717__revenge-inc,This is great! It shows me how to configure the cabin security system by adding features.,"This is amazing. His video cameras can be programmed to examine the shape of anything moving in the field of view and compare it to things that would cause false alarms. It’s got image templates for bears, deer, and large dogs installed. Jack must have gotten lots of false alarms from these creatures before he thought up this program. Damn he was brilliant."
680717__revenge-inc,"Damn. It’s too dark under here. I can’t see the wire colors. I’ll try connecting them to the battery lead one at a time. If I’m lucky I’ll hear the engine start. If I’m unlucky the horn will probably blow. Here goes . . . the engine turned over. As soon as Z and the other two heard the engine come to life they scrambled into the back of the truck and shut the door. That was Shakira’s signal to pull out of the bay and head for the nearby gate. The man in the guard house looked at the truck and glanced at Shakira. “He’s going to stop me, Z! What do I do?","Stay calm, look straight ahead, and be ready to floor it."
680717__revenge-inc,If you pull a gun you’ll be dead before you can aim it at me. The only reason this guy is still alive is because you helped us out.,"What did you do to him, Z?","He got fresh with me. Oh baby. I’m so sorry she busted you up. Come on, let’s get you cleaned up.","Nita, leave him alone. We’re going to get into our cars and get out of here – now!","But I can’t just leave him here, Z","If you don’t leave with us, you’ll get caught. And if you get caught, you will get the rest of us caught. So you can leave now, or I’ll kill you both. Your choice. Either way it makes no difference to me."
680717__revenge-inc,"Oh, excuse me ma’am. I was headed for the men’s room. Are you all right?",You . . . you startled me. Let me catch my breath.,Come over here and sit down for a few minutes. That should help.
680717__revenge-inc,T . . . thank you. I’ll only need a minute. When I get startled it triggers a panic attack. I’ll calm down soon.,Let me order a drink to help relax you. What can I get you?,Bring the lady a coke. And a bourbon straight up for me. I’m Brandon Cunningham.,I’m Rebecca Rose . . . Hughes.,"So do I call you Rebecca, or Rebecca Rose, or . . .",Only my mother calls me Rebecca Rose. I like to be called Becca.,"That’s a nice name, Becca Hughes. Where are you from?",Chowchilla California.,"I don’t have a clue where that is, but it doesn’t matter. Where you are from doesn’t define a person. I split my time between here in Las Vegas and New York City. I have real estate businesses in both places.",Doesn’t your family miss you when you are away?,My parents are dead and I haven’t married. Maybe someday.
680717__revenge-inc,No. I’m not hungry. All right. I guess that would be okay.  She looked around. “Where’s the dining room?,"Actually I thought we could have it in my hotel suite, if that’s agreeable to you.","I . . . I don’t know you well enough, Brandon.","Hey, it’s just dinner. No strings, and you can leave whenever you want.","Well, I enjoy your company so . . . Yes, I’ll join you. Are you staying here at the Golden Nugget?","This old place? Never. I live in a suite at the Trump International, just off the strip.",Is that a good place? I’ve never been there.,It’s just the newest and classiest hotel in town. Come on out front and I’ll have my limo brought around.
680717__revenge-inc,I’ll order some dinner brought up. What would you like?,Is there a menu?,"No, the kitchen will make whatever I order.",I’ll have a cheeseburger and fries.,"Is that it! You have the choice of any meal you want, and you pick a cheeseburger and fries?",It . . . it’s what I’m used to.,What’s going on with you? You’re not what I expected in a bar pickup. What’s your story?,"My husband is after me. He beat me up again so I had to leave. If he catches me he’ll kill me. I waited until he was asleep and took everything he had in his wallet – $138. I needed more so I hocked my wedding ring. I spent most of my money on a bus ticket. I wanted to go to my sister’s place in Dallas, but this is as far as I could get with the money."
680717__revenge-inc,I’m sorry. I only intended to comfort you – nothing more. Forgive me.,I’m sorry for acting this way. It . . . it’s just that . . .,I understand. Let’s get some food in you. That should make you feel better.,No it won’t. Nothing will. I’m afraid all the time. I thought that knock might be my husband until I heard  it was room service.,How could he find you here? No one knows where you are.,"I know that, but being afraid keeps me from thinking straight.",The table is set up for us. Let’s talk some more after we eat.
680717__revenge-inc,"What are you going to do, Becca? You can’t keep running. And you’re out of money. Why don’t you stay here for a few days?","No, it’s not what you think. I just want to provide food and shelter – nothing else. No strings, remember?",How do I know you won’t call my husband and keep me locked in until he gets here?,I promise you I won’t do that. Besides I don’t even know his name or phone number.,"You could get it from the operator. We’re the only Hughes in Chowchilla.  No, I can’t trust you. I can’t trust anyone. I have to leave – now. And don’t try to follow me.","Look, if you won’t stay here at least let me give you some money.","No . . . Well, maybe. But just enough to get to Dallas. That’s all I’ll take.",I can’t use those. If I start handing out big bills like that people will remember me and Kurt will find me.,Here’s all the small bills I have – close to $100 dollars.,"No wait. That’s not all. Here’s my debit card. Withdraw whatever you need from the ATM machine in the lobby, then leave the card at the front desk. You can get up to $500, and it will all be in twenties.","I . . . have no way of paying you back, at least not for now.","This is a gift, Becca, from me to you. There’s no need to pay me back. I have more money than I know what to do with. But if you get back on your feet and this thing with Kurt clears up, come back and visit for a few days – no strings.","Okay, no strings . . . and no promises."
680717__revenge-inc,That’s just the kind of resourcefulness I like to see in my agents.,Agent? I’m not anybody’s agent.,"From this moment on, my dear, that’s exactly what you are. I am Col. Alexei Brusilov of the SVR – the Soviet Foreign Intelligence Agency. One of our responsibilities is to train Russian men and women to serve in foreign countries as undercover agents – spies. You have already demonstrated an essential quality in a spy – the ability to kill without remorse. I’ve gone over your police files covering the brutal murder of your father, and I like what I see. I will take you under my wing and make you one of the best female agents the SVR has ever trained.",Don’t I have a say in this?,"No, you are effectively my slave. Any attempt to escape will result in your immediate execution for the murder. Have her transported to the Institute. They will know what to do with her."
680717__revenge-inc,"There is a guest room prepared for you upstairs, with a maid to attend to you. Please enjoy a full night’s rest and we’ll talk some more in the morning.",I thought . . . I expected . . .,"I understand. You expected me to  do what most men in my place would do. But I’m not most men. You, Zarah, have turned into a woman who should be respected, and that’s how I intend for our relationship to be – one of mutual respect and admiration for each other’s mind and capabilities. We will be the greatest spy team that Russia has ever sent into the world."
680717__revenge-inc,Hi. I’m Melanie. You must be Lynn Preston.,"Yes, that’s me.","We’ve been expecting you. I’ll show you to your room, then you can stroll around and get the feel of the place. The new class orientation starts at nine in the morning.","Is there a class schedule I can look at? Oh, we don’t have classes here. There is no structure. Everyone is given an assignment to complete, and when they’re finished they get a more difficult assignment.","I don’t have a lot of computer experience, What if I don’t finish the course during the six week session?","No one ‘finishes’ the course here. You learn as much as your intelligence and perseverance will let you in six weeks, then you leave.",What time is dinner. I’ve had nothing but airline pretzels today?,"That’s another part of our free-form philosophy. We have a small cafeteria that’s open 24/7 – you just walk in and tell them what you want. We call it the Recharge Station. There are small tables, couches, stuffed chairs scattered around. That’s where much of the interaction among our students happens.",So other students are allowed to help me if I get stuck?,Discussions with other students is where 90% of the learning happens around here. It’s a totally interactive environment – all day and all night. You sleep when you need to and spend the rest of the time working on your assignments.,Wow. I like it already.
680717__revenge-inc,"Good morning, everyone. Would you all please move down front here. I want you to get used to being close to other students from the beginning. Most very smart people grew up as loners, but you have to get over that here since interaction is essential to our learning plan. To break the ice in that regard, I would like each of you to tell us a little about yourself. Lynn, would you go first?","Well . . . to start with I don’t think I belong here. I’m not a computer genius, just someone who does computer investigations for a private investigative agency. My boss thinks I can be more useful to him if I learn about getting into financial records.",Your talking about hacking. Right?,"That’s not something my boss wants known, so we don’t use the word hacking. We call it special investigation.","We’re all familiar with the stigma attached to the word. By stigma I mean the illegality of most hacking. But around here, we’re not shy about admitting we’re hackers. The Government hires many of our top students to do their hacking. We run a special course twice a year for Government programmers to learn how to hack the hackers – to trace exactly who and where the foreign hackers are."
680717__revenge-inc,Will there be computers in our rooms so we can work there?,"No, we want everyone to work together down here. Loners don’t learn much here.","We only use encrypted Ethernet cable access points, so there’s no Wi-Fi available. Wi-Fi is the easiest thing to hack into from the outside, and we don’t want anyone to know what goes on here. If you want to use your personal laptop there’s an internet café around the corner on Broadway that our students frequent."
680717__revenge-inc,"I’ve heard about the underground network of hackers, but I thought most of them used their skills for illegal purposes. I also heard that it is an exclusive group that won’t accept anyone but top-notch hackers into the club. How did you get in?",My husband got me in.,"Oh, you’re married. What does your husband do?",He . . . he’s a retired Federal Agent.,An agent? You mean like FBI or CIA or something.,"Yeah, something like that. But if I told you any more, I’d have to kill you.",I was only kidding. . . . But I would have to give you a lobotomy.
680717__revenge-inc,Did you get help on this from the more advanced students? They’re not supposed to interact with new students this early in the program.,"No, it was all my work.","Then you appear to have a gift for programming. Creating the algorithm first was brilliant. Most student blunder through the routine in BASIC, then try to adapt it to the other languages, which is much more difficult.","Why don’t we work together on the next assignment, Alyssa. That’s okay for new students to work together, isn’t it.","Certainly. Alyssa, stick close to this woman and you will learn a lot."
680717__revenge-inc,Let me try this on my own in C++.,"Okay, I’ll use JavaScript and we can compare results."
680717__revenge-inc,This is amazing. It’s pure genius. Did you write this?,"No, she didn’t. I recognize the programming style. I’ve seen it before on some stuff created by the king of hackers. I know we’re on a first name basis here, but would you tell me your last name, Lynn?","It’s . . . Preston, Lynn Preston.",You must know Jack Preston. This is his style. Are you his wife or his sister?,I’m his wife – his second wife. His first wife passed away. Jack and I were married almost a year ago.,"Jack has taught you well, Lynn. How is he doing now days. I don’t see him much on the Darknet anymore.","He . . . uh, has retired to his cabin in the West Virginia mountains.","Wow. A new wife who is a knockout and a computer whiz, and a cabin in the mountains. How can you beat a retirement like that!","Welcome back, Lynn. I hear you did pretty well at the Recurse Center.","Yes, I did. Apparently I have a gift for programming that I didn’t know about. It’s mostly about the patterns of thinking we develop in childhood – thinking outside the box rather than constrained linear thinking, being able to take leaps of the imagination – that makes a gifted programmer. Whatever it is, I’ve got it. That, plus having Jack as a mentor, turned me into a primo hacker. Turn me loose on a case, Dave, so I can do some challenging hacking."
680717__revenge-inc,So what do you want me to do?,"First of all, become her friend so you can go where she goes without looking like a bodyguard.",Will she know what my job is – that she’s my job?,"No, she’s made it clear to her husband that she doesn’t want protection, but he came to us anyway. You will have to use your natural charm to get, and stay, close to her.",So what do I do when I’m not with her?,Hack your way into her computer so you can trace her emails. Maybe that will lead you to the stalker.
680717__revenge-inc,"Do I have your regular table? I’m sorry, I’ll move.","No, no. There’s no need to do that. I’ll sit somewhere else.","Well, at least join me so I won’t feel like I’m trespassing. . . . please. But if you would rather not have any company, I understand.","Okay. But now I feel like the trespasser. After all I don’t own this table. It’s just that, when you get into certain habit patterns you don’t want to change them.",I’m Lynn . . . Lynn Preston.,"I’m Catherine. Catherine . . . oh first names are enough, Lynn."
680717__revenge-inc,I saw you in here yesterday. Do you come here often?,No. It’s on my way to exercise class so I decided to change my routine and stop here on the way.,Where do you go for your class?,"It’s across town, at the Urban Defense Fitness Center."
680717__revenge-inc,Oh. You’re into Judo and that stuff. I go to the gym up the street for aerobics every day to fight my loosing battle with sagging skin.,It looks like you’re doing a pretty good job of it.,"Thank you, but you’re just being kind. You on the other hand look like the self-defense workouts are keeping you trim. I’ll bet there lot’s of muscle in there somewhere.",Not really. The method they teach isn’t about strengthening your muscles. It’s more about learning how to focus what strength you have on the right places of your attacker.,Now that sounds like something I need. Do they have room for any new students?,I’ll check and let you know. Will you be here tomorrow?,Definitely. I want to hear more about this . . . and you.,"I need to get to my class, but I’ll see you tomorrow."
680717__revenge-inc,"So, where do you live, Lynn?",I live in an apartment building in Logan Square.,Wow. That’s a pretty pricy neighborhood.,"It’s a corporate apartment my employer provided until I can find something a little more in my price range. I’ve been there a month, but my boss keeps my so busy that I don’t have much time to find a new place.",What do you do?,I’m a computer crime investigator for a private detective agency.,That sounds exciting.,Not really. I just study balance sheets and accounting documents looking for anomalies. Sometimes I get lucky and find one.,Does your husband live there with you?,"No . . . no, he died last year. That’s why I started back to work.",Ohhhh. . . . I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to pry.,It’s . . . just that I haven’t been able to let it go. I guess I never will. But it isn’t as painful as it used to be.,"I tell you what. You have to get to your self-defense class. Why don’t I follow you over there and check the place out. If I like it, I’ll sign up.", . . . Great. Good idea. I’ll meet you in the parking lot.
680717__revenge-inc,Dave here.,"It’s me, Lynn. We have a new development from the stalker. He’s taking pictures of Catherine, some of them inside her own house. I just forwarded the email to you. Look it over and let me know what I should do next.",Has Catherine seen the email yet?,"No, I intercepted it as soon as it came in.",Is there a way you can remove the email without leaving a trace? I don’t want her upset about this.,"Sure, I can do that. I’ll store it in the archives on my laptop. Should we try to send the stalker an answer that looks like it came from Catherine? Something we can bait a trap with?","Good idea, but first I want you to find where the photos of Catherine undressing were taken from. The angle should be easy to figure out from the house floor plans, but he could have been anywhere along that line-of-sight path out to a few hundred yards.","Okay, I’ll get on it right after our class. . . . No, I’ll skip class and investigate this. That way I don’t need to worry about her spotting me. I’ll call her now and tell her I can’t make it."
680717__revenge-inc,I don’t have anything I can take to the police. Only what’s in my memory. They can’t arrest him without more concrete evidence.,"Yes, but I know who he is and where he lives. That has to be worth something.",Not really. With no other witnesses it’ll just be a she said/he said thing. And you can’t visually identify him because of his helmet. It might not be Martin at all. Maybe someone borrowed his bike.,You’re right. . . . but I know he has a limp because of my kick to the knee cap.,That’s still not enough for an arrest.,"But if I go over to his house and get a look at him, I’ll know for certain it’s him.",What good is that? It still won’t get him arrested.,Maybe I’ll have to be the agent of justice in this case – plant some phony digital information that will get him arrested for something else.,"Careful, dear. That’s a slippery slope that could get you some prison time.",You’re right. I’ll hold that in reserve as a last resort.
680717__revenge-inc,"Hi Catherine, it’s me. I’m feeling down and need someone to talk to. How about we eat out tonight?","Sure. My Husband’s out of town, so dinner out sounds good. There’s an Olive Garden near my place. Do you want to meet there?",That works for me. Is five o’clock too early? We can get in on the early bird specials.,"Sure. I’ll see you then, Lynn."
680717__revenge-inc,"You seem to be deep in thought, Lynn.",Oh . . . I was running through some old memories.,"Nothing painful, I hope.","No, I’ve left most of the memories of Jack’s death behind me. . . . Or I’ve buried them deeply in my psyche where they will lurk until something unleashes them back into my mind.","You haven’t told me how he died. If it will help you, I’m a good listener.","We were living in my home in Telluride, Colorado. I went into town for groceries and as I carried them out to the car I saw heavy black smoke coming from the hill I lived on. I rushed home to see the whole house in flames. It burned to the ground before the fire department got there. I ran around in the woods shouting for Jack and my granddaughter, Selena, hoping they got out, but they both died in the fire."
680717__revenge-inc,"I’m so sorry, Lynn. I didn’t mean to cause that.","You didn’t cause it, Catherine. Like I said earlier, it was lurking in my subconscious waiting to pounce. Whenever that happens I feel a sense of relief afterward, like I’ve purged the memories from my mind, but I know they have just gone into hiding until the next time.",I know you’re in no shape to go out there and eat supper. Let’s just go over to my place and raid the fridge.,"And maybe talk about pleasant, soothing things?",Do you want to ride with me and come back for your car?,"No, I’ll follow you."
680717__revenge-inc,Come on in and make yourself at home. You want red or white wine?,I’ll have whatever you’re having. . . . What a beautiful home! I’ve never been in a place as nice as this.,Really? You haven’t ever gone to open houses to see how ostentatious homes of the rich and famous can be?,It’s not ostentatious if you can afford it.,I married an investment broker who has more money than either of us knows what to do with. When we had this place built ten years ago I couldn’t wait to decorate it like a modern mansion. Now it all seems useless. This isn’t what life is about. It’s supposed to be about love and family.,Do you have any children?,"No, we tried for a few years without any luck. A few months ago I saw a doctor and she said there was no reason why I shouldn’t be able to get pregnant. She wanted to have my husband in for a visit, but he refused. She only wanted a sperm sample, but he wouldn’t do it. So right after we made love one night I went into the bathroom and used a syringe to extract some of his semen from myself. I took it into the doctor the next morning for analysis. She called me the next day to tell me that the sample had no sperm in it – that he must have had a vasectomy sometime in the past. I was heartbroken – that he would do that without telling me. And I wanted children so badly.",Why would he do that? Doesn’t he love you?,"I thought he did – until I got into his personal files and saw some credit card receipts for women’s jewelry, lingerie, and motels. The bastard had been having affairs for years. With a vasectomy he didn’t have to worry about impregnating any of his women.",Did you confront him? Call him out on it?,"No, I got back at him another way.","What did you do? . . . No, you don’t have to tell me. I don’t want to pry.",I . . . I’d rather not share it with anyone.,Okay. How about some more wine and a change of subject.,I vote for that. Do you have any children?,"I had a daughter, but she and her husband were killed in a car wreck. Drunk driver. He spent two years in prison for robbing me of my only child. Her daughter, Selena, was staying with me, so I at least have her . . . had her.","Okay, we have sandwich stuff, leftover chicken lasagna, hot dogs, and some salad fixings. Anything else will need defrosting. What will it be?","I have simple tastes. A hot dog will be just fine, with maybe a small salad on the side."
680717__revenge-inc,"It’s late, so I’d better be going. I have a bit of a drive ahead of me.","You’re in no condition to drive. I would take you home, but I’m as drunk as you are. Spend the night in the guest room and go home sober after breakfast.","Yeah, you’re right. But I’d feel more comfortable on the couch.",Okay. I’ll get you some sheets and a pillow. There’s a new toothbrush in the guest bathroom.,"I wish you were here with me tonight, Jack. I miss you so much."
680717__revenge-inc,When I came out of the gym yesterday this was stuck under my windshield wiper. I don’t know who it is or why someone would put it on my windshield. Does it mean anything to you?,"No, I don’t recognize him. I don’t know who it is.","You’re sure, Catherine? It seems strange that someone would put it on my car when we’re together in the gym.",I told you I don’t know him.,"Well, it’s of no use to me. I better get going. Thanks for an enjoyable evening. See you monday at self-defense class?",Uh . . . yeah. I’ll be there. Stay Away She’s Mine.,"Lynn, please come back. I need to tell you something.","I wasn’t honest with you. I know the man in the picture. I told you earlier that I did something to get back at my husband for his lying and affairs. Well, I went out and had my own affair – with an exercise trainer at my old gym. Carl Martin is his name. He’s the one who painted your truck. After a month of motel meetings my guilt took over and I ended it. I told him it was over and that I never wanted to see him again.",How did he take that?,"Not very well. He’s been stalking me ever since. My husband hired a private investigator to find out who it was, but I don’t think they have found anything yet. If my husband finds out it’s my former lover, he’ll divorce me. The investigator wanted to put a tail on me, but I told him I wouldn’t stand for it. I didn’t want anyone to find out who it was.","I have a confession to make myself, Catherine. I haven’t been totally honest with you either. I’m your tail. I had to do it undercover so you wouldn’t find out.",You were pretty darn good at it. I never suspected you weren’t who you said you were.,"Oh, I’m who I said I was. You made friends with the real me. I just didn’t tell you the whole story.","Well, I’m glad we can still be friends. Now what are we going to do about my stalker?","I need to talk that over with my boss, Dave Cramer, and see what he suggests. But since Martin hasn’t committed any crimes – other than vandalizing my truck – we probably can’t do anything but get a restraining order.",You mean he can keep stalking me?,As long as he stays far enough away so he doesn’t violate the order. That’s usually only a couple hundred feet.,What can I do? He scares me.,"This is just between you and me, Catherine. Not even my boss can know. I have sort of a hobby on the side where I help women who are being victimized. I can do things with my computer that will cause him a lot of grief – have the police computer create a warrant for his arrest, for instance. Or I can mess with his credit card accounts, even his bank account. I think I can make things bad enough that he will have to leave town. That would solve your problem.",You can do all that! I thought stuff like that is against the law?,"It is. But when bad people need to be straightened out and the law can’t help, I step in.",This is fantastic! When can you start?,I’ll report back to Dave and tell him I identified the stalker. He doesn’t need to know about the affair part. Then I’ll start running him out of town.,"Thank you so much, Lynn. You have lifted a big load off my back. Can we get together every now and then?",Sure. I’ll let you know when I’m finished with my attack on Martin. We can get together to talk about it.
680717__revenge-inc,Mission accomplished!,"Good job on identifying the stalker, Lynn. I’m disappointed that there wasn’t enough evidence to get him arrested, but apparently he has given up his stalking of Mrs. Stevens. Any chance he will start stalking her again?",I don’t think so. I took some measures to ensure that wouldn’t happen.,Do I want to know about those measures?,Probably not.,"Okay, I’ll leave it at that.",Have you got a new assignment for me yet?,"I have something, but I’m worried that it’s too risky for you.",What do you mean by that! You don’t think I can take care of myself?,"No, the last two cases demonstrated that you can take care of yourself just fine.",What then? Is it because I’m a woman?,No. A woman would be just what I need for this case. It’s just that . . . Jack was a good friend of mine. He would expect me to keep you out of danger.,No he wouldn’t. I was in more danger with him than I’ll see for the rest of my life.,I’ll think about it. We’ll talk again tomorrow. Finish up that report for now. . . . And don’t mention the ‘measures’ you took to keep the stalker away.,This is Lynn.,"I’m sorry, I was trying to reach Cindy. I must have dialed the wrong number.",Nancy? Is that you?,"Yes, but I want to talk to Cindy.",I am Cindy. That was my undercover identity for the U. S. Munitions assignment.,Wow. I knew there was more to you than met the eye. I’m calling to ask a question. Do you remember when you said you might be able to help me get revenge on my second husband?,Sure. And the offer is still good.
680717__revenge-inc,Did he hurt you . . . or worse?,No. I told him if he didn’t leave I would start screaming so the neighbors would come and check on me. He pushed me away and left.,Are you free for lunch? We can talk about how to put an end to that.,Great! Where can we meet?,I’ll pick you up at the factory gate and take you to that Chili’s restaurant on 16th street.,"Okay, see you then. You don’t know what a relief it is to have you on my side.","Let’s get down to business. Tell me everything you can about your second husband, starting with his name.",Derek Dalton. He’s a branch manager for the First National Bank. He started there several years ago as a teller and worked his way up. He likes the power and prestige that he thinks goes with the position.,Do you know how much he makes?,"No, he handled the finances.",How about credit cards – does he use them a lot?,I don’t know; he wouldn’t let me get one or use his.,Where does he live?,He got the house in the divorce . . . I had a lousy lawyer.,Does he have a mortgage on it?,"Yes, we had a mortgage but I don’t know any of the details. . . . Oh, wait. I saw some mail from Capitol County Mortgage, so that’s probably where it is.",How about a car loan?,Definitely. He always drives the latest model Mercedes Benz and finances it through First National.,How about affairs? Did he have a mistress on the side.,"Yes, but it wasn’t on the side. He openly flaunted her to me – bragging about how she was a better lover than me, telling me when he was going out with her, and putting her framed picture on his bed stand.",He’s a very cruel person to do that to you. He must have enjoyed torturing you about her. Do you know her name?,"No, I asked several times but he wouldn’t tell me. He was probably afraid I’d confront her. I told him that the woman must not be real if he couldn’t give me her name; that he just made her up to torment me.",What did he say to that?,He dragged me into his study and played a video on his computer showing him and the woman making love.,Are you sure it was him? He could have found a video on the internet where the man looked something like him.,"Oh, it was him all right. He has a birthmark on his shoulder.","Okay, I have the idea. But now I need some details, like account numbers for credit cards, banking, and loans. If I had a picture of the mistress I might be able to identify her. Of course her fingerprints would be even better. Is there any way you could get this information for me?",I still have a key to his house that he doesn’t know about. I suppose I could go in sometime when he’s at work and get what you need.,"That’s pretty risky, Nancy. What if he comes home early? Like if he’s sick or something?",He’s never taken a sick day in his life. And it won’t take me long – I know where he keeps his files with this sort of stuff. If he does come home I can go out the back way.,"Alright, I’ll let you do it. But don’t remove any documents. Use your cell phone to take pictures then put them back. When can you get off work to do this?","I have some vacation time built up, so I’ll just take a day off next week.","Good. If you change your mind, just call it off. I can’t do much without the information, but I’ll figure something out."
680717__revenge-inc,"Jack called it the post-mission high. You must have been terrified, but it sounds like you’re someone who can think clearly in a tight spot.",So what now? When can I hand over the files to you?,"I’ll be off work in about an hour. Why don’t you come over to my place in say, two hours, and we can go over the papers together. I’ll bring some carry-out for supper. Will that work for you?",Sure. Are you still in that old motel near the factory?,"No, that was part of my undercover operation. I’m back at my apartment in downtown Philly now.",Great. See you then.
680717__revenge-inc,How can you afford this place. Are you a millionaire or something?,"Oh, this isn’t my place. It belongs to the company, Cramer Security and Investigation Company. It’s a VIP suite for corporate guests. They’re letting me live in it until another apartment opens up.",Watch out that you don’t get spoiled. It’ll be tough to move down to something ordinary after this.,I’m pretty much satisfied with anything that doesn’t have roaches. . . . I brought home a variety of stuff from P. F. Chang’s. Let’s eat before it gets cold. The dishes are up in that cabinet. You can set the table while I put the food in serving dishes.
680717__revenge-inc,retirement,Your lives sound like a conspiracy novel. With all you’ve been through it might take two novels. When did your husband die?
680717__revenge-inc,Jack was killed in a fire. My home in Telluride burned to the ground with him and my granddaughter inside.,"Oh, how awful!","It was at the time. I went into a dark depression for awhile, but some friends pulled me out of my well of self-pity and brought me here to this job.",Everyone needs friends like that.,"Alright,  let’s get started.","I don’t know what’s in here. I didn’t have much time before I had to get out of there. It looks like Derek has everything filed in subfolders – monthly bills in one, bank and credit card statements behind that, then mortgage and auto loan papers followed by tax documents. Why don’t we each take a subfolder and go through it looking for the information you need, plus anything else that might be useful. I’ll start with monthly bills and write down all the account numbers.",I’ll start at the other end with taxes and work toward the middle.,Will you look at that. You ex has been cheating on his taxes for years.,Like how?,"Well, for starters he’s been claiming the marriage deduction every year since your wedding, even after the divorce. He claims you as a dependent living at home. And there are several suspicious business deductions, including motel bills that are probably from his trysts with the mistress. It looks like he forged your signature on the joint tax return. It will take me a week or two, but there may be enough here to put him in prison for tax fraud.",Put him in prison?,Yes. Is that payback a little harsher than you have in mind?,"No, I was hoping for the electric chair.","Seriously, what level of retribution do you have in mind? We can probably put him jail for the tax issue – that would get him maybe three years. There will be some pretty hefty fines and back taxes to go along with that. Or we can create financial difficulties on various levels – overdrawn credit cards, missing mortgage payments, money missing from his bank account – that sort of thing. We could also get him demoted, or even fired, from First National Bank based on the tax fraud or some apparent embezzling.",What do you mean by ‘apparent embezzling?’,"I can make some money disappear from investment accounts he manages – enough to trigger an audit –  that would likely get him fired. After he’s gone, I would put the money back into the client’s account.",You can do that? How do you do that?,Sorry. Trade secret.,So you could do that to anybody – even me.,It’s possible. But I’m the good guy in this story. I make sure the target has done what he or she is accused of and that the penalty is suitable for their behavior.,So what do you think is suitable for Derek.?,"Well, he should have spent some jail time for abusing you like he did, so I think the IRS legal trouble is appropriate for him.","That’s good, but I want something to happen to his mistress. Nothing real bad. Just enough to remind her of what she is. . . . Oh! Wait a minute. I brought something back from his desk drawers.","There may be some fingerprints of hers on this. I’ll get a friend of mine to lift some prints and try to find a match. Assuming he can identify her, what could we do that would remind her of who she is?",I don’t know. She’s nothing but a glorified prostitute who thinks the term mistress is somehow less revolting.,Let me think about her for awhile. In the meantime I’ll finish going over Mr. Dalton’s tax records to see what else I can find.
680717__revenge-inc,"Thanks for a truly enjoyable evening, Lynn. I can’t remember when I’ve had so much fun plotting against someone who has it coming. I’d better get back. I have to get up early for work tomorrow.",Me too. But I don’t have to drive to work and fight the traffic. I walk to work and stop off for a Starbuck’s on the way.,"Ahh. What a life. I’ll never get there, but I will have peace in my life because of you."
680717__revenge-inc,"Who is that woman, Jack? What are you trying to tell me?","This one is a personal favor, Ian. It’s for a friend I’m trying to help out."
680717__revenge-inc,Maybe I could do this full time. Start my own investigation business to help those who have been wronged.,But how would I find people who need my help? I can’t advertise because what I do is mostly against the law.,Maybe word of mouth – my happy clients telling their friends about me. That would start out slowly but as my client base grows more will come.,I can’t do it all by myself. I would need an assistant to do all the boring paperwork stuff . . . but who do I know that I can trust? Maybe Harriet would want in on this. Her federal agent experience might come in handy.,"No, she won’t want to leave Rick and The Farm to come here to Philly.",But I don’t have to work out of here; I can do my stuff from anywhere. So maybe they will let me work out of the Farm. I could even live there.,This line of thinking is getting interesting. What would I call my business? Preston Investigations?,But I do more than investigate. I help the clients get retribution against those who did them wrong.,"How about Retribution Incorporated . . . no, Revenge Incorporated – Revenge Inc. That has a nice sound to it.",I’ve convinced myself. I’ll go ahead and make some plans.
680717__revenge-inc,"If he’s a big-time drug buyer and seller like I suspect, he definitely wouldn’t want the IRS to know about this account. But if I turn him in for that his wife has no hope of seeing a support check. . . . but . . . maybe I can arrange a way for her to get something from this account. . . . No, the IRS will freeze it as soon as they find out about it. . . . What if . . . what if I hacked into his account and withdrew enough money to open an account in Leticia’s name? But that wouldn’t survive the IRS snooping. There must be a way.","Hi Harriet, it’s Lynn.",I’m so glad you called. I haven’t heard from you in awhile and was getting worried.,"I was on a couple of undercover assignments from Dave, but I’m back in the office for now. Is Rick available?",Sure. I’ll get him. . . .,"Hey, Lynn. What’s up?",I need some financial advice from my friendly wizard.,"I’m no wizard, Lynn.","Based on what you’ve done with our Forsetti funds, you are definitely a wizard. Here’s what I want to do.",I can set up an anonymous annuity that will send a monthly check to the wife and an annual check to the IRS to keep her out of tax trouble. If the annuity is large enough the monthly interest income will cover the checks and the principal won’t be depleted. How much a month are you talking about?,"Oh . . . lets make it $1,000 a month.","Okay. That means that you would need to invest around $240,000 in the annuity.",I can arrange that. But what happens to the principal eventually?,Annuities cover a certain length of time – typically ten or twenty years – then the remaining amount goes to the beneficiary; the wife in this case.,Great. Let’s do a fifteen-year term so the final payout will arrive in time to send the kids to college. Can you do that for me?,It will take me a couple of days to set up the paperwork. Then all I need is the money.,"Let me know where to transfer it to when you’re ready, Rick."
680717__revenge-inc,"If she wants to kill me, how do I protect myself? How will I know if she’s stalking me, or laying in wait somewhere waiting for an opportunity to grab me?","Will you warn me, like you did today?"
680717__revenge-inc,Now tell me again how you found out about the bomb just in time to keep from blowing yourself up,"I heard a voice in my head, sort of a sixth sense, warning me not to get in the car. And when I left the garage I heard the sound of an engine climbing the hill to Jack’s property, so I ran back up to my truck and disappeared into the woods.",Did this other vehicle follow you into the woods?,Not very far. I lost her.,And how do you know it was a woman?,"Like I told you, I could tell it was a woman from the security video in the cabin. She moved like a cat . . . a graceful feline.",Did you find any evidence that might help us identify her?,"No, she was very careful to put everything back in its place. . . . No, wait. I found Jack’s photo of me – the one he usually keeps on his desk. It had a message written on the picture frame glass. It said “You’re next, bitch.",Did you bring it back with you?,"Yes, but it’s in pieces. I dropped it and broke the glass.","Well, get that over to our lab to see if they can find anything on it. I’ll send someone up to remove the bomb.","Okay. Now why did you call me up here, Dave? Is it about that new assignment?","Yes it is. I’ve thought it over and decided you’re ready for it. Next week the CEO of an Italian pharmaceutical company, de Luca Farmaceutico, is coming to Wilmington, Delaware for a week-long conference. He’ll have his wife and 16-year-old daughter with him, along with his personal bodyguards.",Why the bodyguards?,"Most people with his wealth and power keep a staff of bodyguards to protect them and their families. In this case the CEO, Antonio de Luca, has received some threats lately from an environmental watch-dog group who claim that De Luca Pharmaceuticals is polluting the Po River from its plant in Turin. He wants a personal bodyguard for his daughter – but one who doesn’t look like a bodyguard – who will stay by her side 24 hours a day.",I thought you said he already had some bodyguards?,"Yes, but they’re men who can’t follow her into restrooms or stay with her in her bedroom. That’s why I want a woman for this job.",Would I be armed?,"Yes, you’ll need a concealed sidearm with you at all times. But I don’t expect that you will have to use it.","I have my Glock 15, but that’s too bulky to conceal.","You haven’t seen our weapons arsenal yet, have you. Let’s go down to the basement and find a weapon you can hide easily.","You and Jack must think alike. He has a lot of the same weapons underneath the pickup bed. Baby Glock The trigger pull on this one is a little stiff, Dave. I’d have to be careful not to move it off target when I fire it. Otherwise, it’s a good weapon.","I’ve noticed that myself, but with the size of my hand I don’t have much trouble with that. Glock makes another one just like that but with a more powerful 40 caliber cartridge, but that would be even harder to control. Try that Ruger LC9 down on the bottom shelf. That little beauty is less than an inch thick. You could probably hide it in your bra.",Trust me – there’s no room left in there. I really like this one. What kind of holster do you have for it?,We have a slimline holster that clamps onto your belt in the small of your back. With a loose fitting shirt or jacket it would be nearly invisible. I’ll have our weapons technician clean it and deliver the gun and holster to your office later today. Tomorrow we’ll schedule some time in our shooting room for you so you can get used to drawing and firing it.,You have a shooting room here in the building? I’ve haven’t heard any shooting.,"It’s down here in the basement in a soundproof room. State-of-the-art, with a video projector that can create any scenario we choose onto the target wall for you to react to, and then shows where your shots hit.",Terrific. I’ll be down here first thing in the morning.,"Let’s go back upstairs to my office and tell you the rest of the details about your assignment. While we’re up there Donna will give you a company credit card so you can go out and buy whatever clothes you need to conceal the gun and to fit in at the Hotel du Pont. . . . Oh, and you will need to get a concealed carry permit. You can stop by City Hall while you’re out shopping for clothes and fill out an application. Tell them you’re working for me so they’ll expedite it. Tell Donna that you’ll need one of our special cell phones.",What’s special about it?,It can only communicate with other phones on our network using a one or two buttons that connect directly with me or one of the support staff. It’s very thin and flexible so you can wear it anywhere on your body as long as it touches skin.,Why does it have to be against my skin?,"Because when it rings, it delivers a mild electric shock to let you know you have a call. No bells, no buzz; just a tingle. It also has a GPS that will tell us your location, and a panic button that tells us you need help immediately. One of my other investigators will stay within a mile or two of wherever you are, so you’ll get a quick response when you need it.","It sounds like you’ve thought of everything, Dave."
680717__revenge-inc,Good choice. I’ll return it to you once you are officially on-duty.,I’m not on duty now?,"No, Mr. de Luca has the final decision. Come. I’ll introduce you.","Mr. de Luca, may I introduce Mrs. Lynn Preston of Cramer Security and Investigations Company. Mr. Cramer believes that she will make an excellent personal bodyguard for Gabriella."
680717__revenge-inc,"I apologize for my reaction, sir. I should have assessed your attack before I responded. Your eyes would have told me that you weren’t serious.","No, no! Don’t apologize. That’s exactly the reaction I was looking for. You are very good and very quick. You will make an excellent bodyguard for my daughter. Come, let me introduce you.","Dear, this is Lynn Preston. She will be your shadow for the rest of our stay in America."
680717__revenge-inc,"Well then . . . I’ll leave you two alone to get acquainted. Mrs. Preston, your bedroom is the one on the right, Gabriella’s is on the left.",I’ll be sleeping out here on the couch where I can intercept unauthorized people before they reach her.
680717__revenge-inc,Do you carry that gun with you all the time?,When I’m on an assignment like this I do.,Are you any good with it?,"Yes I am. I can put six bullets into a three inch circle from fifty feet away in five seconds. Have you ever used a gun, Gabriella?",No . . . and I’m Gabbi. . . . with an ‘i’. Only my parents call me by my full name.
680717__revenge-inc,What are you writing? Are those the rules I have to follow when we’re together?,"No, I don’t need to write the rules down for you because there are only two. I will stick with you 24 hours a day, and you will never be more than twenty-five feet away from me.",What happens if I want to go shopping . . . alone?,There is no alone. I’ll go with you wherever you want to go.,What if I sneak out on my own?,"If you ever stray more than twenty-five feet from me, I’ll handcuff you to my wrist.",You won’t be able to catch me. I’m a fast runner.,"I’m faster . . . but don’t make me prove it. Now, do you have any plans for today?","I usually go for a walk after lunch, but father’s bodyguards always go with me, so you won’t be needed.",Have you forgotten rule number one so quickly. I will be at your side at all times.,But if you’re beside me on my walk you’ll will ruin my fun.,What fun?,"I flirt with boys I see. I smile and wink at them, and sometimes they stop to chat with me. But they will think you’re my mother and stay away.","Good. Close encounters in a strange city are dangerous. The smiling and winking are okay, but I’ll cut off anyone coming toward you.",Party pooper.
680717__revenge-inc,But what about my privacy?,You can have all the privacy you want when you get back to Italy.
680717__revenge-inc,"Good morning, Mrs. Preston. I brought you some coffee, but I see you already have some.",Thanks for the thought . . . what should I call you?,"Michael will do, ma’am. Here is a breakfast menu. Let me know what you would like and I’ll have it sent up.",Thank you Michael.,Harriet Goodman here. Please leave a name and number and maybe I’ll get back to you . . . or not.,"Hello, and welcome to the mental health hotline."
680717__revenge-inc,"No, seriously Harriet. This is Lynn. Call me. I have a proposition for you.","Are you there, Harriet?","Yes, but let me get over my laughing fit.. Alright, I’m listening for your proposition. Does it involve selling ourselves on the street?","You can if you want to, but what I have in mind is more fun than that. I can’t think of a better cause to use our collective talents for. We’re not enjoying our so-called retirement much. We need something worthwhile to do, and this sounds like it.",I’ll send you some more ideas and action items as I think of them.,"Rick came in half way through your proposition, Lynn, but he’s nodding his head. It sounds great and we would love for you to move to The Farm and run the business from here. Let us talk it over and get back to you later today. Rick can help out with the business setup and administrative details.",Terrific! When do you think we can get started?,"It will take a month or so to get it all set up, Lynn. I’ll check on everything today and give you a more definitive answer this evening.","I’ll be waiting for your call. Bye, guys.",Good morning Gabbi. Did you sleep well?,I wouldn’t know – I was asleep. . . . What was that phone conversation about?,It was personal,"Wow, that’s cool Mrs. Preston. There are lots of people out there who need that kind of help.","If we’re going to be friends, you can call me Lynn.",Thanks. Is there a Mr. Preston? What does he do for a living.,"Jack was an Agent with the Federal Remediation Agency until he retired two years ago, after his wife of thirty-two years died of cancer. He and I knew each other in high school and I rediscovered him on the internet. We were married almost a year . . . but I lost him three months ago . He was . . . he was murdered. I’m so sorry, Lynn. It was dumb for me to ask that question.","It’s Okay,  I can handle it now. I was in a deep depression after his death – I didn’t want to go on. But he talked me into moving forward.",He talked to you? I thought he was dead.,"Don’t think I’m crazy, but he talks to me in my sleep now and then to help me through the grief.",Really! His spirit communicates with you?,That’s what it seems like. But a psychiatrist would probably have a different theory.,"I’m sorry I’ve been giving you a hard time, Lynn. I was really reacting to my father’s attempts to control me. He doesn’t realize that I’m already a woman – a young woman. I can take care of myself.","I had a granddaughter your age, Gabbi. Her name was Selena. We spent a lot of time together at my home in Telluride, Colorado.",She’s . . . gone. She was murdered with Jack. They were shot and my home was burned down around them.,"Oh you poor woman! You have suffered so much, Lynn.","Losing Selena makes me super cautious with regard to your safety. I may seem a little paranoid to you, but I hope you can understand why.","I do, Lynn. And I promise not to give you a hard time about anything anymore. I’ll obey you like a well-trained dog. Thank you, Gabbi.","Mrs. Preston . . . I mean Lynn. I have never been shopping in an American department store. Do you think you could take me this afternoon, instead of our walk?","Sure, if your mother says you can. Let’s go ask her.",de Luca’s daughter has to be getting restless in that hotel room after all this time. Maybe her father won’t let her go out.,Then we will go back to Italy and do the job there.,How we gonna afford that?,I’ll figure out a way if it comes to that. Maybe I can sell your organs on the black market.,"Just keep your eyes on the exit door until we spot de Luca’s daughter getting into the limo. Then buckle up, because I’m not going to lose them."
680717__revenge-inc,"Where would you like to go, Mrs. Preston?","Make it someplace nice, Lynn. Something memorable with the latest clothing and styles.",How does Neiman Marcus sound? It’s pretty much top of the line in department . . .,I know about Neiman Marcus. My mother used to come to New York City a couple of times a year to shop there. I would love to go there.,"Neiman Marcus in Philadelphia, Mr. . . What do I call you?","Leonardo, ma’am","It will be about 55 minutes on I-95, ma’am. There seems to be some delays on that route. I can get us there in under 40 minutes if I take Route 291 along the river.",Let’s do that. It’s more scenic anyway.
680717__revenge-inc,"Dave we apparently have a situation with the de Luca job. I got a call from Antonio saying that his daughter and Lynn hadn’t returned from a shopping trip. His security chief called the body guard who was driving them to Philly and got no answer. The GPS locator on the guard’s phone puts him just off Highway 291 along the river, halfway between here and Wilmington. He’s sending two of his men to that location. What do you want to do from our end?",Get a couple of our guys armed and ready to travel. And let me know as soon as de Luca’s men report back.,Do you have anyone in mind?,Yes. Let’s use Tom Gutierrez and whoever else is available. Lynn and Tom go back a while so he might give us some insight into her thinking.,"I’ll take care of it, sir"
680717__revenge-inc,"Don’t do it lady. Put both hands slowly in front of you where I can see them. That’s right . . . now get out of the car. When Lynn hesitated, trying to think how to handle this, the man jerked her out of the car and smashed the butt of his gun on her head. Lynn felt the lights go out just before she collapsed to the ground. The man looked up at Gabbi. “You aren’t going to cause me any trouble, are you?","N … N … No, sir.",Good then slide over here and get out of the car.
680717__revenge-inc,"I had to kill the driver, but other than that it went down good.",You killed the driver!! Why?,He shot at me; I didn’t have a choice.,"Now we’re really in trouble. We have to move up the timetable – get our five million and disappear before too many cops get involved. Your stupidity is going to make our escape a lot tougher, Carlos."
680717__revenge-inc,We’re right where the GPS says they should be but I don’t see them pulled off the road. There aren’t any side roads they could take. Where is it.?,The GPS locator only shows us where the phone is. If someone hijacked the car they might have thrown the driver’s phone out the window. Walk along that stretch of road while you dial his number – maybe you’ll hear it ringing.,"I doubt it will be loud enough to hear, but let’s double back one more time. . . . Wait! I see some tire skid marks. There it is. We found it Mr. Cramer. It left the road and hit a tree. We’re going down to it now. . . . “Oh no! Leo is behind the wheel with a bullet in his forehead! And the women are gone.",Sit tight. My men are on the way,"We followed those skid marks and found the car smashed into the tree. The left front fender has damage that looks like they were run off the road by another vehicle. He had some injuries from the collision, but the shot to his head is what killed him. So this definitely wasn’t an accident.","There’s some blood back here that must have come from Gabbi or Lynn. There’s not a lot of it, and there’s some on the back of the driver’s seat, so I’m guessing it was an injury from the accident. I don’t see any blood on the other side, so apparently one of them wasn’t injured badly. Based on everything we see here it’s obviously a kidnapping. I’ll report back to Dave and see how he wants to handle it.",Should we call the cops on this?,Not yet. De Luca wants to keep it quiet until we know more. Have Weaver and one of de Luca’s men stay at the scene; you come on back here and we’ll put a kidnap team together to look at our options. Hopefully de Luca will be contacted about a ransom before then.
680717__revenge-inc,It sounds like sleeping beauty is awake. Did you have a nice nap?,"I hurt pretty bad, but other than that I’m alright.  How about you?",I’m alright. They didn’t rough me up like they did you.,That’s because you are the prize they’re after. Their ticket to a big ransom payday.,"It’s more than the ransom, lady. . . . What’s your name?",I thought you were Gabriella’s nanny until I saw the gun Carlos took from you. So you’re what – her personal bodyguard? You don’t look like one.,What do you mean more than ransom?
680717__revenge-inc,"I hired a good drug liability lawyer, who found that the company did a study that showed the drug causes suicidal thoughts at a much higher rate than other antidepressants. They also kept the increasing number of reported suicides from the public. So we sued the company for five million dollars. But they brought in their own team of slick lawyers and had the case thrown out for some legal mumbo jumbo reason. I’m going to get that five million back from the de Luca girl’s father as ransom for you and the girl.",How do they know they’ll get their daughter back alive if they pay the ransom?,They don’t. But they will pay and hope they get her back.,"Carlos, put your mask back on and lock them up in the  basement. You can take their blindfolds off there."
680717__revenge-inc,"They are going to get the ransom, then kill us, aren’t they.",I won’t let that happen. I’ll find some way to get us out of here.,You heard what he said. There is no way out of here.
680717__revenge-inc,"Gabbi, did you know they have a camera watching us from up in that corner? And they’re probably listening to us, too.",Why would they do that?,"To make sure we’re not up to something, I guess.",That’s creepy. I don’t want those men watching me.,"Antonio, I’ve made contact with Lynn. They’re both alive and talking.",I know. I just got an email demanding five million dollars to get them back. It had a link to a live video camera – I can see them both now.,Forward me a copy of the email. Does it say how long you have to get the money together?,Until tomorrow morning. They say they will start cutting off fingers after that – with us watching!,"If they will do that, then they would have no problem killing them after they get the ransom. Can you get the money together by that time?","Yes, I already have my bank working on it. But the kidnappers haven’t said where to take the money. . . . There, I just forwarded the email to you.","Yep. Here it is. Lynn has some blood on her face, but it’s no longer bleeding.","I wish I knew where we were, but with the blindfolds I couldn’t see how they got us here.",Get the tech boys to ping her phone for the GPS location. Then get me some maps and photos from Google Earth.
680717__revenge-inc,Oh my God! He killed her! Dave shouted into the phone “Lynn! Lynn! Talk to me.,What the hell? That bitch had a phone! How do I turn it off? It’s not an ordinary cell phone. . . .,"De Luca, did you see that? They slit Lynn’s throat! The killer picked up her phone, then destroyed it. That shut down the GPS. We have the current GPS reading, but if they move the women we can’t track them. We need to get to that place before they leave!","It looks like they were taken from the wreck north along Highway 322 to a location east of West Chester. The Google Earth photo shows that it’s a house outside of town – the address is 4321 East Strassburg Road. I can have my people there in 15 minutes. We’re closer so my men will get there first, but send everyone you have.",We’re on our way. Dave.,"I have two cars and six men ready to go, sir. They’re waiting for you. Should I call West Chester police chief?","No, this is no job for small town amateurs. We’ll call them in later. Have an ambulance from West Chester standing by for our call.","Pull off the road into that clear spot. We’ll approach the house through the woods. Drive past the house to get a visual, then park and approach it from the rear – we’ll go in the front door. Tom, did you bring the 12 gauge?","It’s in the trunk, along with the other weapons – assault rifles, tear gas, tasers, and plenty of spare ammo clips in case this thing turns into a battle.","There won’t be a battle. This is a surgical strike – we go in, kill anyone who gets in our way, find the girls, and get out quick. De Luca doesn’t want to be connected with this and neither do I. After we’re on the way back to the office I’ll have Donna arrange for an anonymous call to the police.","Unit one here. Is everybody in position? Move, move, move!"
680717__revenge-inc,Damn it! They’re gone. Both of them!,"That could be good news, Dave. If Lynn was dead they aren’t likely to drag her with them. Is there any blood?","Yeah . . . here on the floor. But that’s old blood so it’s probably from Lynn’s earlier injuries. . . . Wait a minute! Here’s some fresh blood, where she was standing when the guy held a knife to her.","There’s not a lot of it. Not nearly enough for a deeply slit throat. Hell, maybe Lynn got some licks in and it’s his blood.","Idiot, idiot, idiot! I knew I shouldn’t have sent Lynn out on this job. Now she might be dead and it’s all my fault.",Don’t beat yourself up. She was the best person for the job and you had no way of knowing it would turn out this way.,But now we’ve got nothing. No GPS and no idea which way they went. I’ll call de Luca and have him pull his men back. We’ll meet him and his security chief back at CSIC to discuss our options . . . options? We have no options. Our only hope is that the kidnappers will call back and we can take them out at the money drop.
680717__revenge-inc,"So what’s the plan, Sissy?",Shut up! I’m thinking. And don’t call me by my nickname.,"We passed an old gas station back there. The windows were boarded up, so no one is there.",Were there any houses close by?,"There was one across the street, but it was boarded up too."
680717__revenge-inc,"See if you can get in that back door, Carlos.","Well, don’t just stand there. Go inside and check it out."
680717__revenge-inc,"Dave, how do you expect they will want the ransom delivered?","The most common method is like you see on television cop shows. The kidnappers will call and tell the money carrier, probably Antonio in this case, to come alone and bring the money to some location they specify. When he gets there they look for signs that he was followed. Then they call the again and send him to another location. They may do this two or three times to make sure that it’s not a trap. When he gets to the last stop they will tell him to put the money somewhere out of sight and leave. After watching the drop location long enough to be sure there aren’t any police, they pick up the money and run.",What about Gabrielle . . . and Lynn if she’s still alive. How do we get them back?,"The kidnappers will usually tell us up front that, once they have the money, they will call – or email – where they are.",What are the chances we’ll get her back alive?,Fifty-Fifty . . . if we’re lucky.,So . . . What? We just sit and wait until they call?,"No, there are some preparations we need to make. I’ll have my techs outfit the car with a hidden GPS locator so we can track you, Antonio. I’ll have another one – one of our special tiny cell phones – inside the money container. As we speak, they’re hiding one inside the lining of a briefcase, and another inside one of Gabrielle’s school backpacks.",What if they transfer the money to another bag and throw the briefcase or backpack out the window?,"When they tell us how they want the money – usually in small, unmarked bills, as they say on TV – we will insert another phone inside one of the wrapped money packs as a backup.","If you’re going to deliver five million dollars in small bills, you’ll need something bigger that a briefcase or backpack.",Good point. I hadn’t thought about that. Just how much space would it take up?,"In twenty dollar bills, the volume would be about nine cubic feet – a little larger than a two feet by two feet by two feet box – and it would weigh over a hundred pounds.","So much for the small bill theory; it wouldn’t fit in briefcase or a backpack, and a hundred pounds if too heavy to lug around. I wonder if they know how big that would be?","Probably not. If they ask for small bills we’ll explain the problem. Maybe they would settle for thousand dollar bills. Then the volume would be less than a cubic foot with a weight of under three pounds. Since they probably have no way to use thousand dollar bills without suspicion, they might want it in hundreds, which would be a box about fifteen inches on a side and would weigh a little over twenty pounds.","Antonio, can the bank put together a package of both thousand and hundred dollar denominations so we’ll be ready to leave as soon as we hear from them?","I don’t know, you’re talking about ten million in cash. Coming up with that amount quickly will be an issue. I’ll have them put it together in hundreds. If they want it some other way tell them they can have it in hundreds within a couple of hours, or they can wait a day for us to get it together.","Sir, I’m forwarding a call to you. It’s from the kidnappers.",This is Antonio de Luca. Whom am I speaking with?,"It doesn’t matter what my name is, I’m in charge here. Do you have the money?",You didn’t specify how you wanted it – what denominations. I can’t put it together until you tell me.,Are you aware how much space that would take up? You’re talking about a container at least three feet on a side.,So? . . . Put it in a box!,That many bills will weigh over one hundred and fifty pounds. It will take at least two people to lift it.,"Damn it, Gloria! You should have thought of that. . . . Tell them to put it in a suitcase with wheels.","Did you hear that, Mr. De Luca? Pack it into a wheeled suitcase.","I have the money ready to deliver, but it’s in hundred dollar bills. It will be more manageable than . . .",Hold on.,"The hundreds will be good. Now get your ass in a car and bring it. You have three hours. . . . Goodbye, Mr. de Luca.",No. Wait. Don’t hang up! Where do we deliver it to?,"Uh . . . yeah, I forgot that part. I’m new at this. I will call you back.","Did you get a trace on that, Jimmy?","No sir, it was a cell phone. The best I could do is identify the cell tower it originated  from.",Where is that?,Give me a minute . . . there’s the tower. It’s about twenty miles north of Westbrook.,Can you get some of your people up to that area to standby until we get more information?,How large an area are we talking about?
680717__revenge-inc,"If I put four teams around the perimeter, on the highways, the one closest to where they are would be no more than thirty minutes away.",What else do we know about the kidnappers? I get the feeling we’re missing something. Do we know what kind of vehicle they’re using?
680717__revenge-inc,"This next camera monitors the exit from the hotel into the garage. This footage was taken just as Gabriella and Lynn came out and got into the limousine. Next we’ll move to the camera that captures all vehicles entering and leaving the parking garage. Thirty seconds after Leonardo drives out onto the street the same white van follows them. It may mean nothing, but the timing is suspicious.",Did you get a license number?,Not on this shot. But I backed the video up to when the van showed up at ten after seven this morning. As they came down the entrance ramp the camera caught the license plate for less that a second. I’ve got the tech people trying to freeze and clarify it. We should hear from them any minute.,"How could you be so stupid, Gloria? First you didn’t consider the huge amount of small bills that would take, and then you forgot to tell them our plan for the drop off. What’s going through that tiny brain of yours? This was supposed to be easy – one, two, three and we’re outta here. Now we’re on the run before we even have the money. We have to get the ransom and get away soon or they’ll start closing in on us.","Hey! Back off! I don’t need you jumping on me for every little mistake. Nothing’s really changed. We go ahead with the ransom drop off and pick up plan we came up with, head for JFK airport, and leave the country. Nothing to it.",It better work. One more of your screw-ups and I’ll drop you off in front of the police department in handcuffs.,"Yeah. You and who else, you wimp?"
680717__revenge-inc,"You gonna threaten me you better have a weapon in your hand. Now put your weapons on the table and back away. All three complied because they knew Gloria didn’t make empty threats. She gathered up their guns and growled “You can have these back when we go for the pick up. Carlos, you call de Luca back and tell him the plan.",This is de Luca.,"Here are the instructions. Mr. de Luca will deliver the ransom tomorrow morning. Put the money in an overnight bag with wheels and go to the Millbourne station of the Market-Frankford subway line. Board the train that leaves for City Center at 7:21. Get off downtown at the 13th street exit, walk down one level to the Broad Street Line, and stand next to the men’s restroom with the suitcase beside you. Someone will come up to you with a note telling how to get your daughter back. Walk away from the suitcase, board the southbound train, and don’t look back. We will have people watching. If we see anyone following you, we leave and your daughter dies. Have you got that straight?","Yes, I believe I do.","Good. If you’re late, she dies. If anyone follows you, she dies. If you plant tracking devices in the package, she dies.. . . . click.","Well, we can throw the GPS tracker idea out. And the downtown morning subway rush will make it all but impossible to follow the pick up man – lots of escape routes, multiple trains, hundreds of people moving everywhere. I don’t see how we can track him or the money. And even if we could track him, after the others pick him up they would be crazy to go back to where they’re holding the girls.",If they’re serious about killing Gabrielle –  and Lynn if she’s still alive – they will leave someone there to carry out the kill order and meet up somewhere later.,"Good point, Tom. Our best chance is to focus on finding where they are being held. Any progress on clearing up the license plate image?","I’ll go check on it. We got it. It’s an Ohio plate registered to a Gloria Durant, who lives in the Lincoln Heights section of Cincinnati. The van is a white 2012 Chevrolet Express passenger van. That’s all I have. If we had Lynn here she could hack into some records for more detail, but . . .","Thanks, Tom. We’ll get this information out to Lou’s teams. Maybe we’ll get lucky and spot the van.",Have you got this straight? Tomorrow morning we’ll take the van to the Millbourne subway station and park near the entrance. I’ll go inside to pick up the suitcase while Butch here follows behind me looking for a trap. Darrel will stay in the van keeping a lookout for suspicious vehicles or people in the parking lot. If either of you sees anything – anything at all that doesn’t seem right – call me on your speed dial.,Why can’t I be in the van? Leave Butch here to watch the women. Because you’re the only one I can trust to kill them. These two don’t have the guts to do it.,Why do you have to leave tonight? I don’t want to stay awake watching the women all night?,Because I don’t want to take a chance on traffic slowing us down in the morning. We’ll park at a 24 hour Wal-Mart and sleep in the van. Once we have the money we’ll drive back here to pick you up and head for New York.,"Time to leave, boys."
680717__revenge-inc,Hey. Carlos. I need the bathroom. Bad . . . Hey! Did you hear me?,If you don’t let me go I’m gonna crap in my pants and you’ll have to put up with the stink all night.
680717__revenge-inc,Wow! Are you superwoman or something? That was amazing. He didn’t know what hit him. Can you teach me that stuff?,Maybe someday. For now let’s get those leg cuffs off you and get some help.,This is David Cramer. Who am I talking to?,"It’s me, Dave.",Who?,Lynn! Did you forget about me so soon?,No. We saw the live video of someone cutting your throat and thought maybe you were . . . were dead.,"It was a shallow cut, just into the skin. It bled some but there’s no permanent damage. He was just trying to scare you and Antonio; let you know they were serious.",Where are you! We have some men in the area.,Just a second. Gabbi. Go out front and see what the address of this place is.,But what street is it on?,"There’s no street sign in view, but it’s a defunct gas station named Blake’s Gas and Auto Service.",We can work with that. Someone will be there shortly.,"One more thing, Dave. The woman who leads this gang has a change of plans. She’s going to intercept de Luca at the Millbourne subway station, not in City Center.",Great! I’ll have some men there to grab them.,We are also going to need an ambulance out here.,What? Are you hurt? Is Gabbi hurt?,"No, but the guy I beat up is in bad shape.","I’ll never forget you, Lynn. And I’ll miss you. Please come to Torino and visit.",I’ll miss you too. And you let me know anytime you’re in the country. I’ll drop what I’m doing and come see you.,"You have done so much for us, Mrs. Preston. I feel I must repay you somehow, but you wouldn’t take the money I offered. Would you take it if I doubled the amount? Made it $200,000?","No sir. It’s not the amount. I was just doing my job. But if you ever need my services again, anywhere in the world, just call Dave."
680717__revenge-inc,What was the most important asset Lynn used in this?,"Lynn has an incredible gift of resourcefulness and cleverness, coupled with a quick mind. I would have her to teach us how to acquire these qualities but, for the most part, these thing are innate and can’t be taught. But if you hang out with her enough, maybe some of it will rub off. We’re very lucky to have her as an asset in CSIC."
680717__revenge-inc,"This assignment was very taxing on you, both emotionally and physically. Frankly, I don’t know how you got through it. When I thought they had killed you I hated myself for giving you the assignment. I imagine you feel totally drained by it all.","No, not really. It was a great adrenaline rush. I haven’t felt so alive since before Jack died.","Well, regardless, I’m going to keep you here at the office for awhile on desk duty. I’ll find the most interesting cases I can for you to work your hacking magic on. What kinds of cases do you prefer?","Actually, I found the deadbeat dad assignments rewarding. I’d like to continue working on those for awhile. Not the ho-hum everyday ones. Give those to someone else. I want the challenging ones.","Good. I’ll sift through the cases and cherry pick the tough ones for you. But for now, take a couple of days off to recuperate.",Can’t do that. I need something to do – to keep me busy – to get my mind refocused.,Don’t argue. Get out of here.
680717__revenge-inc,"Well thank you Dorothy Bradbury! I don’t remember meeting you, but there were so many people at the ball, and I was pretty drunk. It’s all a jumble in my mind. That’s a nice chunk of change. I’ll transfer it now before you change your mind.",Site is unavailable at this time. Please try again later.,Damn internet! It’s always something. Too many people online first thing in the morning. I’ll try later. But the money got my motor going this morning. I’ll spend a few minutes in my secret playground.
680717__revenge-inc,What are you looking at?,"I always loved watching you sleep, Lynn. With your face so relaxed your true beauty shows through.",Are you trying to seduce me?,Not something us spirits can manage. At least not with an earth-bound human.,"So what are you here for, my wonderful spirit husband?",To help you get Ritter. I’ll leave it as a question. Where does he get his girls from and what happens to them after he’s finished with them?,That’s two questions.,The answers will give you what you want.,What do you  mean? What do I want.? . . . Jack. Jack?
680717__revenge-inc,Yessss! This is it. I have a video showing the pedophile senator raping a girl who ended up murdered.,"So, who do I send this information to? Who will act quickly on it? I already ruled out the Feds and the Philadelphia police . . . But not the Harrisburg police! The District Attorney will jump on this unsolved murder so fast that Ritter – and VEC – won’t know what hit them."
680717__revenge-inc,"Where’s your mind at, Daddy? You don’t look happy.","You’re right, sweetie. I let my mind go somewhere it doesn’t belong. Thanks for breaking me free."
680717__revenge-inc,When does your game start?,"In 45 minutes, but Lorena’s game is almost over so we’ll make it in time."
680717__revenge-inc,"Did you see that last goal, Daddy? That was a move you taught me.",I sure did Lorena. I saw all three of your goals today. Keep that up and you may get a college soccer scholarship. . . .  Let’s get moving. We have to make it to Claudia’s game.
680717__revenge-inc,"Did . . . did you know mother is seeing someone, Dad?","No, no I didn’t. Is it serious?",I don’t know . . . Maybe.,What do you girls think about him?,He’s nice. Brings mother flowers and candy for us. But I don’t think she’s serious about him.,"You don’t think she’s serious, or you don’t want her to be serious?","Both, I suppose. We don’t want anyone around to replace you. We would never let that happen.","I’m glad you feel that way, but Mary Catherine is probably lonely and wants some companionship.","No, she just wants someone else to boss around, to control.","You’re probably right about that. . . . Well, here we are, with six minutes to spare."
680717__revenge-inc,"Oh my, I must have knocked you cockeyed. Your right eye is looking way off to the right while your left eye is trying to focus on me. Try closing your right eye.",You! You’re supposed to be in prison!,"You can’t keep a good killer locked up. The smart ones – like me – will find a way to get out. Well here I am, free as a bird, and ready to avenge Alexei’s death.",I don’t know anything about that. I left the case after you were sent to prison. I don’t know what happened to Alexei.,"You may not know anything, but Lynn Preston, knows. I think she killed him, maybe  at his hideout in Wisconsin. So it’s really about getting Lynn to talk – which is hard to do without her cooperation. But to save your life, I think she will cooperate.","Don’t bet on it. She won’t believe you have me. And if she does, she’ll come in with the cavalry, guns blazing.","How will she know where you are? You don’t think you’re still in your apartment, do you? Oh, I forgot. You can’t see a damn thing.",Where the hell am I?,Someplace she will never find you. Now let’s talk about getting a souvenir for her so she knows you’re alive.
680717__revenge-inc,It’s an entire index finger . . . from a right hand. It was severed by a sharp instrument in a single stroke – there aren’t any jagged edges. What we don’t know is who the finger belongs to. Can you get a scan of the fingerprint?,I’ll be back with my laptop in a couple of minutes.,No. Nooo! It’s Tom Gutierrez. Someone cut off his finger!,This is proof of life . . . proof that someone is holding Tom captive.,How do we know if he was alive when it was cut off?,The wound continued bleeding after the trauma. So he’s alive . . . At least he was when the finger was severed.,What do we do now?,I expect we will get another message from them with their demands. As of now we are on high alert. No one goes in or out without an I.D. badge.
680717__revenge-inc,Is this Zarah who I think it is? Alexei Brusilov’s accomplice?,"Y . . . Yes, it’s her. The one who was sneaking around at Jack’s cabin. The lady in black from my dreams. What am I gonna do, Dave?","Before we can come up with a plan you need to make the call so we know what she’s got planned. Come, use my office phone. I can set it up to record the conversation.",Lynn Preston I presume?,"Yeah, it’s me. And if you do any more to Tom, I’ll hunt you down and kill you myself.",Bold talk when I’m the one holding the cards.,What do you want?,"No. I tied him up in his HumVee and sent it to the bottom of the lake at his place in Wisconsin. I don’t know if he used up the trapped air or froze to death first. Either way, he paid for killing Jack and my granddaughter.",You will pay for that!,"What have I done, Dave? Signed Tom’s death warrant?","No, I don’t think so. She still wants you – and Tom is her only leverage to make that happen. No, she’ll keep him alive to trade for you. She’ll send another email any minute now.","If I knew where she and Tom were, I’d give myself up right now. Tom’s got a family and I have no one. If I cause his death I couldn’t go on living.","This is Zarah’s sickness, not yours Lynn. She’s a psychotic killer with no conscience. Don’t heap the blame on yourself."
680717__revenge-inc,What is it? Something else from her?,Don’t know. I haven’t opened it yet. It might be a bomb for all I know.,"Ahhh! No, no, no! This isn’t happening. It’s one of my nightmares. Come talk to me Jack so I know it’s a dream."
680717__revenge-inc,"Alright. What now, Dave?","Come with me, Lynn. We’ll put together a strategy team in the conference room and explore our options.",What options?,We won’t know until we start brainstorming the problem.,We might be here awhile so I had some food and drink brought in. Let me start by bringing you all up to date on where we are on this problem. . . .,So we haven’t gotten any communication from this woman since she hung up on Mrs. Preston?,That’s correct . . . unless there’s a note in the latest package. Our forensic tech is examining the package now. As soon as he has something he’ll let us know.,"Well, what did you find, Darren.","There’s good news and bad news. The bad news is that, like the finger, the foot was cut off while the . . . the, uh . . . ‘patient’ was still alive. It looks like it was done with a small chain saw.","Well, what’s the good news.?","It’s not good news really, but it might be. I don’t really know.",Out with it! What is it you are struggling to say?,Sorry. I’m not usually that blunt.,Yes ma’am. I understand . . .,So say it already!,"There was a note inside the wrapper. . . . Here, you read it."
680717__revenge-inc,"This is now a police matter. We don’t have the resources for a full investigation. I’ll call Matt Murdoch, Chief of Detectives and an old friend from my FBI days. He has the pull to get anything done, and he doesn’t let rules get in the way. He once told me that rules were for when you run out of brains.",Can he get his people on this immediately? I hear they’re pretty busy over there.,He’ll make it happen.
680717__revenge-inc,"My people and facilities are at your disposal, Matt. If we don’t have it, we’ll get it here pronto.","Thanks, Dave. I’d like to start by interviewing everyone who is involved in this, starting with Mrs. Preston. Is she available? I understand that she and Mr. Gutierrez were close friends. Is she in any shape to talk?","Oh yeah. She got past the emotions and is now in her emotionless analytical mode. And she’s very bright. . . . I don’t know if I should tell you this, but just between us, she is also an ace hacker. She can get into pretty much any computer system, pull out information, and leave without a trace. . . . Just in case you need that sort of thing.",Who knows where this will lead. Would you have her brought into a spare office so we can talk privately.,"It’s that office across the hall, and she’s waiting for you."
680717__revenge-inc,Mrs. Preston?,Yes?,"I’m Matt Murdoch, the lead detective on this case. May I ask you some questions?",Go ahead.,Why don’t you start by telling me everything you know about Mr. Gutierrez?,No. . . . I can’t do that. I can’t think of him right now. We’re close friends.,How about the woman who is holding him? This Zarah Savvin?
680717__revenge-inc,"I guess the best place to start is Barbados in the Caribbean islands. Tom was down there investigating the murder of a friend, Jim Norton. He found evidence that led him to a woman guest who lived next door to Norton’s condo as the prime suspect. He pretended to be interested in her – let her pick him up in a bar – and when she tried to poison him he turned the tables, tied her up, and called the police. It turns out she was a serial killer the FBI called the praying mantis killer, because she would seduce her male victims, then kill them right after having sex. . . . That’s what praying mantises do.","Whoa. I’m going to need a lot more detail than that, Mrs. Preston.","No, you don’t. That’s got nothing to do with the present situation, other than she is holding and torturing Tom as retribution for sending her to prison.",So she went to prison then?,Yes. The FBI had her extradited back to the States and gave her twenty years in a federal women’s prison in California.,"So, did she escape from there?",Of course. How else could she be here?,I’ll check on the escape details.,"Again, you’re wasting time on irrelevant details, Mr. Murdoch. We need to find out where she’s holding Tom and move in before she mutilates him even more!","You speak very directly, don’t you Mrs. Preston.",No time for wasted words. And call me Lynn. I’ll call you Matt.,What else can you tell me?,I did an online investigation into Zarah Savvin last night. She’s killed five men including Jim Norton. She’s Russian. Came here eleven years ago. Worked for a shady private investigator named Brusilov. Sentenced to twenty years at the Central California Women’s Facility in Chowchilla. She and three other women escaped three and a half weeks ago. Zarah’s the only one they haven’t caught.,"That’s great, Mrs. . . Lynn. I’ll send someone to Chowchilla to question the other women. She might have talked to them about her plans.",Exactly what I was thinking.
680717__revenge-inc,Do you have any information about where she might have lived before she went to prison?,"No, but I’ll find that out as soon as I get back to my computer.",Why don’t you do that now. That could be the most promising lead yet.,Give me thirty minutes.
680717__revenge-inc,"This is an address registered to Alexei Brusilov in Alexandria, Virginia.","Is it current, or could he have moved?",Someone pays his taxes for him. That might be Zarah.,If he’s still living there he probably pays them himself.,"No, he . . . He travels a lot. Hardly ever home. He may have his bank take care of it.",How do you know he travels a lot? Do you know him?,"No, but my husband did.",Did know Brusilov? Is Brusilov dead?,"No, my husband is.","Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. How long ago did he die?",Not relevant. Get some people to that Alexandria address.,Right. I’ll get the FBI out there immediately.,What has your team found out?,"It’s a little early in the investigation, Mrs. Preston. They’re just getting organized.",So you have nothing to show for the past hour. I knew calling in the police would be a waste of time.,Our forensic team is working on the severed limbs and the packages they were delivered in. But nothing yet.,Delivered? . . . Yes. That’s it! Have they questioned the couriers who delivered them? They had to pick the packages up from somewhere.,"No, but we’ll get right on it.",So your computer routing system took you both to the same pickup address?,Yes sir. It was an old warehouse down in the Navy Yard area – 4911 South Broad Street.,Who handed you the package?,It was left outside the office door.,So you didn’t see anyone?,No sir.,"But I did see a vehicle parked near the door. It was a black Chevy Avalanche, a couple years old.",That’s it! That’s her truck!,"And how do you know that, Mrs. Preston?",Irrelevant. But I know it’s her.,"Get moving. Frank, call the chief and have him put together an assault force. We’ll swing by the station for guns and vests and meet him there.",You have a lot of explaining to do when this is over.
680717__revenge-inc,Oh Tom. I’m so sorry I did this to you. All she wanted was me.,Thank God. Thank you Lord for sparing him. What is it Tom?
680717__revenge-inc,Good morning Detective Murdock. I see you already poured a cup of coffee. Let me get a cup and we can begin.,"Good morning to you, Lynn. Go ahead and get your coffee; I’m in no hurry this morning."
680717__revenge-inc,"Okay, I’m ready. Fire away with your questions.","Before I get into that I want to tell you how this is going to go. I’ll ask direct questions and you’ll give me direct answers. None of the ‘It’s not relevant,’ or ‘You don’t need to know that’ stuff I’ve been getting from you. I need to know everything you know, then I’ll decide what’s relevant. Are we clear on that?",Yes sir!,Let’s start with Tom Gutierrez. How long have you known him? When did you first meet him?,"I’m not sure exactly. He was a friend of my husband, Jack Preston, before Jack and I met. We got together about a year and a half ago, and I met Tom shortly after that. Before Jack retired Tom worked in the Federal Remediation Agency, the FRA, with him.",What’s the FRA? I haven’t heard of that.,If I told you I would have to shoot you.,"I told you I wanted direct answers, not your usual beat-around-the-bush crap.","Oh, that was pretty direct. Jack and Tom were agents for the FRA. What they do is highly classified. Jack could only hint at it to me.",Does this case have anything to do with their work? Was Zarah Savvin a spy also?,I didn’t actually tell you that Jack and Tom were spies. You jumped to that conclusion yourself.,So they weren’t spies?,"Well, that’s not exactly true. But I can definitely tell you that Zarah’s kidnapping of Tom had nothing to do with Tom or Jack’s agency connection.",I want to know more about your husband – Jack Preston. What was his full name?,That’s not relevant. Jackson Joshua Preston. He died a few months ago when my home in Colorado burned to the ground. . . . My granddaughter with him.,"Oh . . . I’m sorry, Lynn. I won’t ask any more questions about your husband. I’ll take your word that none of what happened here has any connection to your husband. Is that a true statement?","Well, not exactly.",There you go again! This is getting us nowhere. I could ask you questions all day and leave here with nothing useful.,"Look, Matt. Why don’t you let me tell the story my way. Then if you have any questions, I’ll try to answer them.",Alright. I guess I’ll have to be satisfied with doing it your way. Go ahead.,"Jack had a friend, Jim Norton, who had retired to the Caribbean with his life savings. Norton fancied himself a ladies man, so he rented a condo on the beach tried to pick up young women for one night stands. One of the women was Zarah Savvin, from the condo next door to his. It didn’t take him long to get invited to her place for the evening. That’s the last anyone heard of him. When Jack couldn’t reach him, he sent his friend Tom down there to check on Norton. He discovered Jim was seen at the bar with Ms. Savvin on the night he disappeared, so he went to the bar himself that night and let her pick him up. When they went to her apartment she tried to do the same thing to Tom, but he ‘got the drop on her’ as they say in cop movies. He tied her to a chair and called the local police. I told you the rest earlier – about how she went to prison for several murders and escaped recently.","Yes, I checked on that and what you told me is exactly what happened. Remind me where you got that information about Zarah.",The internet.,That’s funny. I had my computer guys try to find the same information and they had no luck.,It’s all in how you search the web – and where you look. I’m gifted in that area. Actually I’m not all that gifted. I learned most of it from Jack before he was killed.,"Killed?? You said he ‘died’ in the fire, now you say he was killed?","Yes. He was murdered. The fire was arson. You can check with the Telluride, Colorado police chief.",Who did it? Have they been caught?,Yes. . . He was caught and executed.,Executed? Colorado doesn’t have a death penalty.,Incarcerated. I meant to say incarcerated. . . . But I spent a lot of time wishing he would be executed.,"I can understand that, Lynn. You must have been very angry.","Yes, I was. And that anger put me into a deep depression for a couple of months.","Again, I’m sorry. But let’s get back to . . .","No, let me get back to my narrative about Tom and Zarah. The Telluride situation had nothing to do with that.","Alright. But I’m making a list of all the questions I want to ask, and it’s getting pretty long. Go ahead with your story.","There’s not a lot to tell after her prison escape. Somehow she got back east and tracked Tom down. Her anger at Tom for giving her up to the police probably festered in prison, so when she escaped he was number one on her to do list.",What about the notes Ms. Savvin included with the body parts she sent? Your name was included in them. Why would she be after you?,Ms. Savvin somehow found out that it was Jack who sent Tom to the Caribbean to find Jim. She told Tom before he left her tied up that someday she would get even with both him and Jack.,"Come on, Lynn. You can do better than that. This story gets more unbelievable by the minute.",I . . . I need a bathroom break.,"Dave, I need your help. His questions are pushing me toward telling what really happened, not just with Tom, but about Jack and Alexei and stuff. What can I do? Get a lawyer?",Come on. Let’s go back in there.,"Matt, you and I go way back, so you trust me, don’t you? Because I have to know I can trust you.","Absolutely, Dave . . . unless it’s about a crime she committed.","It’s about that last phrase. Lynn, Jack, Tom, and even me, have been involved in some pretty shady things over the past few months. Trust me when I say it was to stop some very dangerous things from happening to this country. In the process Lynn has broken several laws, but in every case it was justified by circumstances. She’s worried that if she has to tell you about these things, you might have her prosecuted.","You’re putting me in a tight spot, here. Technically, if I know about a crime I’m required to report it, even if it occurred somewhere else.","Well, unless you want her to bring in a lawyer and plead the fifth on every question, you need to figure out a way that you can deal with this.","Here’s how we will handle it. I will preface every question I ask from here on with the word ‘hypothetically.’ And you, Mrs. Preston, will begin your responses with ‘hypothetically speaking.’ That will keep us all out of trouble and give me the information I need to sort this out. Does that work for you?","Okay. We have a deal . . . hypothetically speaking, of course.",Lynn. May I resume my questioning now?,Go ahead . . . Matt.
680717__revenge-inc,"I have one more issue to cover, Lynn. It might touch on some emotional issues for you, but I have to ask.",Go ahead.,"When we were wondering where this woman lived before prison, you went off to do some computer magic and came back with an address in Alexandria. It belonged to one Alexei Brusilov. Why did you think she might have lived there too?","Zarah worked for Brusilov in his private security business. They were pretty close, so I searched some computer data and found where he lived. It was a long shot, but it was all we had.","I sent the FBI there immediately, if you recall.",Yes. What did they find?,"This Alexei Brusilov was quite a character. He had files on several illegal activities he and his agency were involved in. If we ever find him, he will spend the rest of his life in prison.",Did you find anything related to Savvin?,"Yes. She was definitely spending time there before she went to prison. But she returned there recently, after her escape. There was a vehicle in the carport that was stolen from the Las Vegas airport the day after her escape. They also found a wall safe that had been opened recently.",What was in it?,"False identity papers for her and Brusilov, and information on a shared bank account with a large amount of money in it. She has made several withdrawals from it in area ATMs over the past week. We alerted the bank to notify us as soon as she uses it again.",So there’s a chance you might catch her?,A very good chance.
680717__revenge-inc,"So here’s my last question for you, Lynn. Actually two questions. First, how did you know to search for the name Alexei Brusilov? Did you know him?",". . . Hypothetically speaking, let’s just say our paths crossed. . . . He tried to kill Jack and me a couple of times.","Here’s the last question. I checked with the Telluride police chief – he sends his regards, by the way – and found that you husband and your granddaughter were both shot in the head before the fire started. Were Brusilov and Savvin responsible for their murders?","Brusilov, but not Savvin. She was in jail already. Alexei Brusilov shot Jack and Selena . . . and O’Malley.",Who’s O’Malley? His name hasn’t come up before. The police chief didn’t say anything about him.,"O’Malley was a her, not a him. And she was my Irish setter."
680717__revenge-inc,Aren’t you going to ask me the final question?,"And what question would that be, Lynn?",How about what happened to Alexei?,I don’t see that it’s relevant to our case here. I’m finished.,"Thank you, Detective Murdock.","This probably is not the best time to ask, Mrs. Preston, but could I take you to dinner sometime?","I would like that, Detective Murdock."
680717__revenge-inc,"Maybe it’s time for me to make the break – to go out on my own. To start up Revenge, Inc. I can find plenty of cases in the news to go after, and Catherine Stevens hinted that she has a couple of friends that might need my services. . . . Yep. I think it’s time. I’ll call Harriet about coming to The Farm for the weekend.","At last. Some female company! I love Rick and all, but men don’t know how to chat. Come on in and have some supper. Rick’s got some ribs in the smoker and his special sauce is to die for.",Where am I sleeping?,Anywhere but with Rick. He’s mine. Take your pick of the guest rooms.
680717__revenge-inc,"Hey, Lynn. It’s great to see you! You’re looking healthy. Working for Dave must agree with you.",It’s been an adventure – actually several adventures. I’ll tell you about them sometime.,Oh no you don’t. You don’t get to give us a teaser like that and then clam up. Tell us everything.,Won’t dinner get cold?,The longer my ribs stay in the smoker the better they taste. Let’s go in the living room and get comfortable.
680717__revenge-inc,"You’re lucky to be alive, Lynn!  Zarah had you in her sights and you got away. So where is Zarah now?","No one knows. She disappeared after she got away from me at the warehouse. The FBI staked out Alexei’s home for a week, but she didn’t go back there. They issued a BOLO alert in the surrounding states but that came up empty. I guess we’ll just have to wait for her to show herself again.",But your life is in danger. She could be stalking you back in Philly.,"Dave has some of his people watching my back for now, but he can’t keep that up.",You need to move out here for protection. Don’t forget that Jack put in the same perimeter security system here that’s at the cabin. We’ll keep that activated full time until Zarah is caught.,"Actually, that’s why I came out here. I’m ready to get my Revenge, Inc. business off the ground, and I would like to headquarter it here. Is your offer to let me move in still good Harriet?",Of course it is. When can you move out here?,I haven’t told Dave yet. I’ll need to give him two weeks notice so he can find a replacement for me.,"A replacement for you doesn’t exist, Lynn. No one can come even close to doing what you do as well as you do it.","Thanks for the compliment, Rick, but I’m nothing special.",Oh yes you are. Dave would have to hire two or three people to cover all the skills you have. And he will never find a hacker as good as you.,"I’ve been thinking about that. I’ll offer to do my internet magic for CSIC as a part- time consultant. That will keep me busy while we figure out how to drum up business for Revenge, Inc. Have you given any thought to that, Rick?"
680717__revenge-inc,"The second idea is to follow criminal and civil court cases and identify clear injustices – criminals who walk on a technicality, or bribe witnesses. There are way too many of those cases to look through, but we’ll select the worst and go after them with our own form of vigilante justice.","That’s going to keep all three of us tied up full time, and I don’t want that. Rick, I think you can manage the business without too much work, while Harriet and I do the research to nail them. How about if we hire a lawyer full time to comb through court cases and alert us to the ones that need our help?","Not a bad idea, but since much of what you do – hacking, changing financial records, moving money out of bad guys’ accounts – is illegal, a lawyer might think it’s his duty to turn you in.",I didn’t think of that. Everything we do has to be hidden from the law. Maybe we could find one who has been disbarred or something. . . . The smell of those ribs is making my stomach gurgle. When can we eat?,Give me ten minutes to set the table while Rick cuts up the ribs.,"Morning, Lynn. Have a seat. You look like there’s something on your mind.","There is. I haven’t told you, but I’ve been doing a little work on my own – after hours, of course.",That sounds intriguing. What’s it about?,"I’m using my computer and hacking skills to right some wrongs, to help people who have been treated unfairly get what’s theirs, even if it’s just getting even. I don’t want to go into any more detail than that except to say that, even though it’s done for noble purposes, much of it is frowned upon by the law. I’ve been using false identities, so my work can’t be traced back to you or me.",I don’t have any problem with you doing a little moonlighting.,"It’s more than that, Dave. I want to start doing it full time – making a business out of it. This work gives me a great sense of satisfaction. I think it’s what Jack would want me doing.",Have you got a name for this business?,"Revenge, Inc. I thought about Retribution, Inc., but it doesn’t have the same ring to it. So anyway, I would like to have your blessing on this. I’ll stay around for two more weeks to wrap up my work for CSIC, then I’ll move out to The Farm with Rick and Harriet, my partners in this calling.","It sounds like you have planned well, Lynn. You have my blessing, but I will really miss your internet expertise.",I have a proposal about that. How about I make myself available as a consultant to CSIC on an as-needed basis?,"How can I turn down an offer like that. And if you have need of our security services, I’ll do the same for you. And forget about that two week notice. I’ll assign your cases to other investigators. You can leave whenever you’re ready.","Thanks, Dave.","You and Jack are really special to me, Lynn. You keep in touch.","Hello, This is Lynn Preston. Hello?",Uh . . . Hi Lynn. It’s me . . . Matt . . . Murdock.,Hi Matt! It’s nice to hear from you.,". . . Uh, how’s everything? . . . Damn, I’m no good at small talk. I called to ask you out to dinner.",When?,"Tonight if you’re free, but if you have something else to do, I understand. Maybe another night then?","Tonight is perfect, Matt. I’ve been looking forward to your call. . . . Where are we going?",I’m sorry. I’m not very good at this. I don’t do this often. Would the M Restaurant at the Morris House Hotel be alright with you?,That would be wonderful. What time?,Oh. How about if I pick you up at seven?,How about if I meet you in the hotel lobby?,Sure. That will work. Seven o’clock then.,"See you there, Matt.",I’ve got nothing to wear I haven’t been on a date since my first husband courted me in college.,But I still want to look nice. The M is really upscale. I can’t go in looking like a slob.,But jack is gone. He would want me to go after some fun in my life.
680717__revenge-inc,You’re right. He will never meet my expectations . . . But what if I lower my expectations? Maybe he’s a close second to Jack.,There’s got to be a dress in here somewhere. I don’t have time to go out and get a little black dress. . . . How about this one. I used to look good in that.,Leave me alone. Get out of my head.,A good psychiatrist could make you leave!,"Well, if you’re going to hang around, help me pick out something to wear.",Ugh. It’s in the back of the closet for a reason. How about this grey knit two-piece?,Damn it! Stop it. You’re no help at all.,Maybe I should just call and cancel.,"No, I don’t really want to. I’m looking forward to this. . . . There it is! My navy blue Chico Veronica knit dress. It’s perfect. Knee length, a neck that I can unzip as far as I want to. It really shows off my figure – at least whatever figure I have left.","What’s next? Half slip, full slip, no slip?   . . . No slip. The dress will stick to me because of the static.  Now here’s a nice bra and panty set. Black, a little lacy. Yes, I’ll wear these.","But the lacy ones make me feel more confident, more feminine."
680717__revenge-inc,What can I help you with today?,"I . . . I’m not sure. I have a dinner date with this woman tonight – well, it’s not really a date, just dinner – and I thought I should bring some flowers. But I haven’t dated in years so I don’t have a clue what I should get her.",Is this your first date with this woman?,"Like I said, it’s just dinner.",So it’s the first time you two have been out together then. Is the dinner at her place?,"No, no. Nothing like that. It’s at a restaurant.",Then I would suggest something simple. Do you know what her favorite flower is?,"No, I don’t really know her that well at all.","Well, I hate to lose a sale, but it may be too early in your relationship for flowers.",Thank you for straightening me out on that. I was so afraid I would give her the wrong thing – send the wrong message.,"I glad I could help. When you get to your third or fourth date, maybe dinner at her place, come back and I’ll help you out."
680717__revenge-inc,"Hi Lynn. I was waiting outside the door for you, but you walked right by me. Maybe if I wore my rumpled work suit you would have recognized me.","Oh, no Matt. My mind was somewhere else. You look great. That color suits you.",You look . . . really good yourself.,I have a table reserved for 7:30. I thought we could have a drink at the bar until then . . . unless you don’t drink.,"A glass of wine would be great, Detective Mur . . . Matt. Sorry, it takes some getting used to.",What kind of wine did you have in mind?,"Red or white, Lynn.",I’ll have whatever you’re having.,I don’t really drink much wine. I don’t have a clue what these wines are. I’ll call the wine steward.,"No, don’t. I’ll have a vodka martini with a twist.",In that case I’ll have a scotch on the rocks.,"So, are you any closer to finding Zarah Savvin?",You just broke my cardinal rule – no shop talk on a date.,So that’s your number one date rule?,Not really. I just made that up. I haven’t been on a date in a long time.,Why not. An attractive man like you should find plenty of women to date?,I’ve embarrassed you. I’m sorry. . . I just meant that . . .,"Look, I think we’re both uncomfortable worrying about what the other is thinking. I’m looking forward to having an enjoyable evening of conversation with someone I may want to be friends with. That’s all. It’s just dinner.","You have a terrific way of cutting to the core of a situation, Lynn. My expectations are the same as yours. So lets get on with the enjoyable conversation. Tell me about your childhood. Where did you grow up?","Well, I’m a West Virginia hillbilly with one leg shorter than the other from walking around the mountain. I grew up in Coal Creek, down in the southwestern coal mining district. That’s where I first met Jack Preston. For me it was love at first sight, but he had things to do and places to go – college, marriage, the Air Force, then the FRA. He retired after his wife died and built a cabin in the eastern mountains of West Virginia.",How did you two meet up again and get married?,"I found him on the Internet a couple of years ago. We started emailing each other, and he showed up in Telluride later. The rest is, as they say, history.",Is that when you two got involved with Alexei?,You just broke your cardinal rule. . . . Let’s talk about you now.,"Okay. I can do that. I joined the marines out of high school – Perry High School in Pittsburgh – and, after boot camp, I was stationed at the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979 – one of the Marine’s missions is to guard American embassies around the world. Anyway, I was there in November when the mob of Iranian revolutionaries attacked. I was wounded in the firefight before they overwhelmed the defenses and flown out in a medical evacuation helicopter with three other wounded Marines.",So you weren’t one of the sixty American hostages held at the embassy for fifteen months?,"No, but I should have been. It took some time in therapy to work out my survivor’s guilt from that.",How bad were your injuries?,"I took two rounds in the chest, one nicked an artery. It was touch and go for awhile but the medics kept me alive until I got to a military hospital. I was in the hospital for three months recovering.",Did you return to active duty?,"No, they decided to give me a medical retirement. I protested it – I really wanted to get back to embassy duty . . . No, that’s not completely true. I wanted a chance to prove I wasn’t a failure as a Marine. But they wouldn’t let me do that. So I did the next best thing. I became a cop. First I went to college and got a degree in criminology, then went through a course at the FBI Academy in Quantico to study crime scene investigation. That’s where Dave and I met. After that I applied for a detective opening with the police department here and started out as a greenhorn detective.",You must have been good at it. They made you Chief of Detectives.,"That took a few years, but I guess I was still trying to prove myself. . . . The Maitre de is signaling. Our table is ready."
680717__revenge-inc,"I really enjoyed our evening together, Lynn.","Me too, Matt. You’re comfortable to be with.",Can we do this again – soon?,"That sounds great, and I really want to but . . . I’m leaving town tomorrow.","What, for a few days?","No, I’m actually moving in with some friends in Virginia. They have a large gentleman’s farm west of Leesburg. Harriet and Rick are my two closest friends. I might not be here today if they hadn’t rescued me from my depression after Jack was killed.","It’s not far, less that a four-hour drive. I’m sure I’ll get back here now and then. We can get together then.",But what about your job with Dave?,I’m actually starting my own business that I’ll run out of the Farm.,What’s the business about?,"Private computer investigations, stuff like that.",Oh . . . you’re good at that. I’m sure the business will do well. What are you calling it?,Rev . . . I haven’t really picked a name yet. Maybe Preston Investigations.,That would make sense.,Take a right up ahead and we’ll be there.,"Thanks again for the great time, Matt. Call me sometime.",Sure.
680717__revenge-inc,"That’s new. They must have put it in for my protection. I’m not sure it would slow Zarah down much, though.",Finally. We were looking for you an hour or two ago.,I had to finish packing my things. Most of my clothes are still in drawers and closets back at the apartment. I just brought some casual stuff to hold me until I can go back for the rest.,Drive the car around back and I’ll open the garage doors. I have a surprise waiting for you.,My Miata! You guys brought my Miata back from the cabin. Thank you! I really love driving that beauty.,I know what you mean. I got to drive it back from the cabin. It really handles great on those West Virginia mountain curves.,I couldn’t keep up with her in my Escalade. She beat my home by twenty minutes. You’ll have to let me take it out sometime.,Consider it community property. We can all drive it.,You and Harriet go on upstairs and pour us a drink. I’ll put the boxes and luggage upstairs.,Oh no. I’m not letting you do the work by yourself.,I won’t. Bring the box over here and put it in this cabinet. Henry here will carry them up for you.,Now that’s neat. The senator thought of everything.,Yes he did. Henry is large enough to hold a person sitting down and has inside controls . . . in case someone needs to sneak away from an upstairs bedroom.,With all the people who showed up for his weekend soirees it was cheaper than another butler. It stops at the kitchen and in the upstairs hallway. You two go on up and I’ll load your stuff.,This is so peaceful and lovely. I don’t think I’ll ever live in a city again. Short visits when necessary. But otherwise I’m declaring myself a country girl.,Wait ‘til the leaves turn color. Now that’s real beauty. The trees at Jack’s cabin have already turned. In the Mountains the color show is three dimensional. Takes your breath away.,"I used to get some of that in Colorado. They don’t have the variety of colors, but the gold of the aspen patches mixed with the dark evergreens is a whole ‘nother kind of beautiful. There’s a narrow gauge railroad that winds through the mountains from Chama in northern New Mexico to Silverton in Colorado. In the fall when the aspens turn thousands of people take that ride. They have to reserve a seat on the train and a room in a local motel almost a year ahead of time. But the aspens only stay at their peak for a week or so, and when that will occur depends on the weather and nighttime temperatures. Making reservations for the right time is a crap shoot.",We all should go out there next year to see it.,"If we time our trip right, we can also go to the International Balloon Fiesta in Albuquerque. That’s another beautiful sight.",How did you know about that?,"Dave called yesterday to check on the new security fence. He arranged for the installation. . . . He worries about you, you know. So, what’s up with Detective Murdock?",We both enjoyed the dinner get-together.,"It was a date, Lynn. Call it what it was.","Well, at first I didn’t think of it as a date, but by the end of the evening it definitely seemed like a date.",So when is the next ‘date?’,"That will be tough with me living out here. If Dave needs me back in town for some consulting, maybe we can get together.","Don’t let the fire die down, dear.",What fire?,"I saw your eyes light up when I mentioned him. You can’t fool a woman about these things. Right, Rick?","Not being a woman I can’t confirm that hypothesis. I’m just a silent bystander. But maybe you can invite him out to The Farm for a weekend sometime. . . . I’m getting hungry, Harriet. When’s supper?",I’ll get started on it dear. Give me an hour.,"An hour! I’m talking starving, here.","I can provide a good chicken and dumplings dinner in an hour, or you can have a meat loaf TV dinner in ten minutes. Or, if that’s not fast enough, I can have a bowl of cereal in front of you in two minutes. I love the way you two banter back and forth."
680717__revenge-inc,"If they catch the guy, I’ll add my own form of justice to whatever the courts dish out. . . . Time for some more coffee.","I don’t know if this is a case you can do anything about, Lynn, but let me tell you about it anyway. I help out at the Lynchburg Seniors Center – where the older folk, mostly poor older folk, gather for free meals, bingo, conversation, and sharing their dislike of the Government. I spoke with a couple yesterday, Larry and Eugenia Adams, who are having a problem with their son and daughter-in-law. They are both in their early seventies and living on nothing but his social security. She stayed home to raise a family so she has no income.",That must be tough to live on just that single income.,"She said they live simply, own their fifty-year-old home, which is now in a run-down neighborhood ignored by the city. They have lived on that income since he retired. But the problem is their oldest son and his wife. They come by their house with a sob story about how he lost another job and is broke and needs cash, or something they can sell – like her jewelry or his stamp collection. If they don’t give in to his demands, he yells at them and threatens to have them committed as mentally incompetent. So they give him whatever they can and leave the bills unpaid. Their power has been shut off for the past two months, and they need $1,342 to get it restored. But even if they did that, they would come up short again the next month.",Wow. How can children treat their parents like that? That’s awful. Can I pay their power bill for them?,"I offered to do that, but they refused. They’re too proud to accept financial help. So I outsmarted them. I went to the power company and prepaid their account for the next two years – anonymously.","How nice of you, Harriet. But where does Revenge, Inc. come in?",I thought maybe you could check up on their son and his wife. See if he’s lying about his financial situation. Or maybe he’s supporting a drug habit. There’s got to be something you can do to get him off their back.,Great idea! My thinking has been too limited about the kind of cases to look for. Give me the son’s name and I’ll go start on it now.
680717__revenge-inc,Time for some bacon and eggs.,And what are you so cheerful about this morning? Did you have a sexy dream about the detective?,"No, it was better than that. I just nailed my first bad guy as president, founder, and chief investigator for Revenge, Inc.","Well, don’t let it go to your head, dear. What was the case about?","Larry and Eugenia’s terrible son. I found a drug connection from his past – he ratted out a big-time Puerto Rican drug lord. It turns out that he wasn’t only stealing money from his parents, but he killed someone a couple of years ago when he was in the Navy.","So, what did you do to him?",I sent a letter to the drug lord and told him where to find John Adams.,"Wow. . . Serious stuff, Lynn. Are you sure you want to go that far?","Yeah, I do. With what he’s been doing to his parents, his own smuggling, and the dead sailor in San Diego, he has it coming. The Navy justice system had their chance and did nothing.",Alright. I’ll go along with you on this one. But do you think the three of us should be involved in decisions like this in the future?,"That’s a good idea. I guess we need to come up with some procedures that will keep us all in the loop. . . . That way, you two can join me in prison when they catch me.",I can see one problem you overlooked on this case. What happens to his parents? Is there any way they can get back some of that money they lost?,"You got me on that one, Harriet. That part of the deal slipped my mind. I’ll look at his assets this afternoon and see if he and his wife have been saving the stolen money. Then I’ll channel it into their bank account a little at a time so they won’t notice.","What about their son’s death? As bad as he was, they might be heartbroken if he’s killed.","Maybe in the short term, but in the long run I think they’ll realize he was slowly squeezing the life out of them with his stealing.",I also like Harriet’s idea of reaching a case-by-case consensus on the choice of revenge actions. We have to be careful that we don’t get carried away with our power as a self-appointed judge and jury.,"You’re right about that, Rick. Have you two got anything planned for the weekend?",It’s our thirty-sixth wedding anniversary. We’re planning a couple of days in the Poconos. We spent our honeymoon there and as a surprise gift Rick booked the exact same cabin for the weekend.,"How sweet, Rick. Every woman needs a husband like you. I’ll give her a few minutes then see if I can comfort her."
680717__revenge-inc,"Are you alright, Lynn? Are you hurt? I was so worried.",Just in my mind – I’m really pissed off. I feel violated even though I wasn’t living here anymore.,At least you were armed.,Not when I went in. The intruder stole the gun I kept in the apartment. I got this one out of Jack’s truck.,Now we can go up and have a look. I’m glad you had sense enough not to touch anything.,"Well, you’ll find a large knife with my fingerprints on it. That’s the first thing I grabbed.",Now that’s the Lynn I’ve come to know. Always ready for a fight.
680717__revenge-inc,"There’s something you need to see. Now I know where to find you, bitch. Thanks for the gun. I’ll use it to blow your head off.",That was undoubtedly written by the woman who is after you. Zarah something.,"Savvin. Yes, it’s her work. I’ve seen it before.",You have? Where?,"At Jack’s cabin in West Virginia. It’s where he lived before he . . . before he came to Telluride. He had a first-class security system in the cabin and around the property. Last month my laptop alerted me that someone was up there. It turned out to be Zarah. She went through the house and left me a note like this. I got some good video of her, but nothing that shows her face clearly. I headed up there immediately.",Did she do anything else?,Uh . . . she put a bomb under the seat of the car I left there.,A what! What kind of bomb.,It was an IED – a block of C4 with a pressure switch. It almost got me. I was getting into the car to start the engine when Jack warned me.,Really? How often do you hear from him?,At first it was almost every night. He helped me come out of my depression. But I don’t talk to him much any more.,"So you see him at night, like in your dreams?","Not really dreams. He usually can’t come to me unless I’m asleep, but I’m not dreaming about him. It’s more real than that. But a couple of times he spoke to me when I’m awake. To warn me. Like with the bomb.","You know, I believe you. My grandmother had the same experience after grandpa died. He would tell her things that were going to happen days or weeks beforehand. And if she dozed off in her rocker, I could hear her talking with him.",So you don’t think I’m crazy?,No. I don’t understand the human mind – or the hereafter. No one really does. But I’m certain that the mind is capable of unimaginable things. And the hereafter? That’s God’s realm and we will never know what goes on there. . . . Not until we die anyway.,So what do we do now? She destroyed the apartment so much I can’t come back here any time soon. I’ll have to call Dave and tell him to get things back to normal in here and send me the bill.,Send you the bill? How the hell will you pay that off. . . . I can help you with that.,No need for that. Jack had an insurance policy that left me a good bit of money.,"So where will you stay tonight, Lynn?",I’ll find a hotel room.,"I, uh . . . don’t want you get the wrong idea. But there’s an extra bedroom in my apartment. You’re welcome to stay there.","Thanks for the offer, Matt. But I would be more comfortable staying in a hotel.",Uh . . . okay. I understand. I was out of line for suggesting it.,"No, you were just premature in suggesting it.","Well, we’re through here. Can I drop you at a hotel?","No, I have my truck.","Okay. If you need anything else, call.","Actually, I have a confession to make. Part of the reason I came to town was to ask you out to dinner.",Really? That’s great. I’m free tonight. Where would you like to go?,I searched the web for something and found my kind of place. It’s called Hill Country Barbeque over on Chestnut Street. They have New York style ribs and live country and western music.,Really? You like that kind of music too?,Grew up on it in Coal Creek.,I’ll run home and change into appropriate clothes. Want me to pick you up at your hotel?,"No, I’ll get into my duds and boots here and meet you at the restaurant. Does seven o’clock sound okay?",Yep. I don’t expect any interruptions.,"That was another delightful evening, Lynn. I didn’t know you shared my love of country music. Do you ever go to shows by big name singers?","No, I don’t like the crowds. I prefer the smaller settings. I have to admit that this is the first time I’ve been to one since before Jack and I got married.",Jack didn’t like country and western?,We were always too busy trying to change . . . change stuff.,Stuff? What kind of stuff?,"I don’t want to talk about it, Matt. But maybe I’ll tell you someday."
680717__revenge-inc,"I think we’re beyond shaking hands, don’t you think?",It would seem so. I’m glad.,Maybe you could come out to The Farm for a couple of days. I’d like you to meet my best friends.,I would like that.,When can you come?,I’m swamped at work for the next couple of weeks. I’ll call you when I see some free time on the horizon.,Great. I’ll be heading back out there tomorrow unless Dave has some work for me.
680717__revenge-inc,The young lovers have returned! How was the vacation?,"Absolutely fabulous. A nice mountain resort with a world-class chef, mountain hiking trails with wildlife at every turn, and a private cottage for our intimate moments that brought back all the old memories. It couldn’t have been better.","You’re making me jealous. I wish Jack and I had taken time for a honeymoon at a place like that. We had to settle for one night in a cheap motel that would take cash, and woke up to a serious political situation we had to deal with. . . . But that night was . . .","Well, we didn’t quite capture the bliss of our honeymoon. We no longer have the . . . stamina.",You two must be tired from the trip. I’ll fix us something for supper.,No need for that. We had the resort chef put together a wild game gourmet meal for three and put it in a thermal box to keep it warm. A couple minutes in the microwave and the house specialty will be ready.,Just what is the house specialty? Sautéed raccoon?,Close. It’s roast Bambi – venison.
680717__revenge-inc,"This reminds me of a quote I read somewhere that goes ‘True friendship comes when the silence between two people is comfortable.’ In this case it’s three people, but the principle still holds.","I’ll toast to that. Now that the silence is broken, we might have a new case for you, Lynn.","Yay, another villain to grind into dust. What’s it about?",I haven’t heard about them. How big are they?,All I know is the name. You’ll have to find the details on the web.,"So, what’s the beef against them?","Rick and I met this couple that works at the resort – he’s a maintenance man and she cleans rooms. We came back to the room after breakfast to find the woman, Myra, crying. She apologized and tried to leave but I asked her to stay and tell us what’s troubling her. She said her seven-year-old daughter was going to die unless she got medical care, and they couldn’t afford the cost. Rick asked if she had medical insurance, which they did, but the company wouldn’t pay for the operation.","Both Myra and her husband, Ozzie, are covered by their employee health insurance plan from OCHI. The girl’s liver and lungs are deteriorating and she needs a combined liver and lung transplant to replace them.",Why won’t the insurance cover it?,"They claim that, because it’s an inherited genetic problem, it’s a pre-existing condition.",Has she had it all her life?,"No. She inherited the genetic structure from both of her parents that left her highly susceptible to the condition, but the symptoms didn’t show up until she turned six. The insurance paid for the diagnostic tests that confirmed what she had, but OCHI cut her off once they discovered it was genetic.",What’s the operation going to cost?,Over a million and a half dollars.,No wonder they don’t want to pay. Have there been any court cases that support their position that a genetic disease is a pre-existing condition?,That’s something I’ll have check on. So what’s our plan of attack on this?,"Let’s do it this way. Rick, you investigate the legality of their position. Find out if Ohio Consolidated can get away with this. Harriet, why don’t you dig up everything you can about this alpha-one antitrypsin thing and see if other insurance companies have covered the operation. Meanwhile, I’ll examine OCHI’s records and find out what I can.","How about another round, bartender?","It was that last glass of sherry you called for that did this to us, Lynn.",You’re right Harriet. I forgot that sherry is fortified with added alcohol. What have you got to cure us with?,"I could prescribe a ‘hair of the dog that bit us,’ but it’s too early to start drinking. How about some strong coffee and a couple of Aleve?","Okay, but let’s get those into our system quickly so we can start working on the new case. What’s the daughter’s name?","Emma, Emma Boswick.",Alright. I officially name this case ‘operation Emma.’ Should we let her parents know that we’re trying to help?,"I don’t think we should just yet. It might get their hopes up, and we don’t know if we can deliver.","You’re right Rick. We’ll wait until we know more. . . .  Where’s that coffee, Harriet?"
680717__revenge-inc,This is awful. The CEO is a cold-hearted bastard. How can I stop this? . . . Time for a pow wow with Rick and Harriet.,"What’s up, Lynn. It sounds important.","It is. Here’s what I found on the CEO’s computer. What do you think we should do, Rick?","I would need to see the Boswicks policy and read the fine print to see if it allows them to take this position. But in the absence of specific language about genetic diseases that don’t show up at birth, I think they’re vulnerable to a legal challenge.","That’s what I thought, but with their willingness to delay a law suit indefinitely, it could last for years. By then Emma will have died. On top of that the Boswicks can’t afford the legal costs of a lengthy  litigation. We have to find a way to take care of this now.",I think we should threaten the company with an immediate negative publicity blitz if they don’t reverse their position on this. It would be nice if we could make the emails public but there’s no way to prove that they’re authentic. He could claim that we made them up.,"If I hack into The CEO’s computer and send the emails directly to media and Government recipients, they can be traced back to the IP address of his computer. That will guarantee their authenticity. Will that work Harriet?","Brilliant, Lynn. But I think we should send the CEO a message telling him what we’re about to do before we actually do it. Maybe that will be enough to convince him to make the change.","Good approach, girl. We could be open to some lawsuits ourselves if we release the emails.","We’re safe from that possibility, Rick. If I erase the hacking trail to his computer no one can ever trace it back to us.","That’s what I love about you, Lynn. Your devious mind. You could be a very successful criminal.","Except I’m on the side of truth, justice, and the American way.",Yeah. You and Superman.,I’ll go get started on this. See you at supper.,"Umm, something smells good. Is dinner ready?",Almost. Did the CEO give in?,"I don’t know yet. I gave him 48 hours to respond. He will need to talk it over with his legal staff first. But just to prove to him that my threat is real, I sent copies of the emails from his office computer to his wife’s laptop, so he’ll have some explaining to do when he gets home. . . . I’ll set the table."
680717__revenge-inc,"Hi Lynn. This is Matt – Matt Murdock, the detective.",You had me at Matt. What’s up?,I have three days off this weekend. You said to call if I could get the time to come to The Farm for a visit.,"Yes, I did. That would be great! So when can we expect you?",Let me check with Harriet and Rick. They’re right here. Hold on.,Matt wants to come out for the weekend. Will that interfere with any of your plans.,If we had plans we’d break them for this. Tell him to come on.,"Matt, it works for them. Do you know how to get here?",I have your address. My GPS will find you. Should I bring anything?,Just some warm clothes. The nights are still a bit chilly here.,I’ll pack my long johns.,"We’ll look for you Friday, then.",Okay. Bye.,He’ll be here before lunch on Friday. I’ll make him something special.,We’ll need to do some shopping tomorrow. Just you and me. We’ll leave Rick here to guard the fort.,Sounds like a plan.
680717__revenge-inc,"What do you think, Rick? You look good in that, dear. Really good.","You sure know how to make a woman smile. I bought another outfit, but you’ll have to wait ‘til bedtime to see it on me.",And you know how to make a man smile – and fill his head with thoughts for the rest of the day.,I thought you might like a snack after working so hard at shopping.
680717__revenge-inc,Have you heard back from the insurance CEO yet Lynn?,I haven’t checked today – lets have a look. Uh oh. Not good.,What?,He says that he won’t give in to extortion and he knows how to fight people like us. He had his public relations people release a statement to the news outlets that a smear campaign has been launched against them involving fake emails that discredit the company. In the release he hints that a rival insurance company is behind it.,Darn. What do we do now? Rick have you got any ideas?,"Not yet, but let me shift my mind into that gear and see what it can come up with. I’m going out on the deck for some solitude.","I think I have something. How much control over the company’s computer system do You have, Lynn?",I can do pretty much anything I want to. My hack let’s me roam around inside the memory banks.
680717__revenge-inc,Step two is another press release from OCHI to the media highlighting their humanitarian decision to pay 100% of the medical costs for poor little Emma Boswick. Include a photo of Emma if we can get one. . . . I’ll call the Boswicks and ask if they can email us some pictures. Once the press release hits the media they won’t dare go back to denying payment.,"Ohhh, I like it. Who’s the devious one now, Rick.","I’m no match for your skills in that area, Lynn. But we do have a certain synergism, don’t we.","Yes we do. Rick, will you draft the letter to the Boswicks while Harriet puts together the press release? I’ll go back into the OCI computer and see if I can make it print the letter and send it out in their morning mail. That’s going to be a challenge."
680717__revenge-inc,Well? What did you find?,"I was going to hold you in suspense until after supper, but I’m too excited to wait. Sending out the letter and press release through OCHI is a piece of cake. How are you two coming?","We were done an hour ago. We’ve been waiting for you, slowpoke. I even got Myra Boswick to send me a recent photo of Emma. She’s in bed looking sickly, with tubes coming out of her. That will create widespread sympathy and make it certain destruction if OCHI tries to renege on the letter."
680717__revenge-inc,"Thanks, Rick. I needed this.",Figured you would. What’s the timetable for today?,"Well, Matt’s coming sometime before lunch and I want to get his guest bedroom ready.","I already finished that. Fresh sheets, pillow cases, towels, washcloths, and toiletries.","Wow, you run this place like a first class hotel.","Yeah. I figure when we get older maybe we’ll turn it into a bed and breakfast for the Washington gentry. You’d be surprised at how many overworked, overstressed people from the DC area would treasure a few days out here. Since we’re already rich we don’t have to make a profit, so we can pick and choose who we let stay here. We can keep up with the latest scandals and affairs by eavesdropping on the guests.","And I could install hidden cameras in all the bedrooms so we can record the activity. That way, if we do run out of money, we can get rich on the blackmail payments.","Like I said, a devious mind. And a pervert.",What’s the weather supposed to be like this weekend?,"I haven’t checked yet, Harriet.. Looks good Friday. Saturday will be good until after dark, then a storm’s coming in.",I hope it doesn’t interfere with our weekend. I’m looking forward to some extended time with Matt. I want to find out what he’s like when he’s not on his best dating behavior.,The two of us will give you guys plenty of time alone. You could even take him up to Jack’s cabin tomorrow.,"That’s an idea, but I’ll see how things are going with us before I commit to that.","You’re really being cautious about this, aren’t you Lynn.",I’m not sure how I feel about taking the relationship beyond friendship.,I think you’ll know after this weekend.
680717__revenge-inc,"Hello. .. Hello? . . . Is anybody there? Come on up to the house, Matt. There’s room in the garage to park your car. I’ll meet you down there. Are you two coming down with me?","I don’t want to seem too eager, so I’ll stay in the living room.",Me too.
680717__revenge-inc,"It’s so good to see you again, Matt. I . . . I missed you.",Me too. . . . I mean I missed you too.,You must be tired after the drive.,Not really. I knew there was a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.,You certainly know the way to a girl’s heart.,"That sounded corny, didn’t it.","Not at all, Matt. I enjoyed the compliment . . . it was a compliment, wasn’t it?","Yes yes, of course . . . Oh, I get it. That was a sample of your humor.",At last. You’re starting to understand me.,I’m sorry. It’s just that I’m uncomfortable around women.,"I’m not a woman, I’m your friend.","I could debate that point, but it puts me more at ease. Thanks.",Lunch ready in five.,Let me show you to your room so you can freshen up. Did Rick send your luggage up with Henry?,"Henry? Oh, the dumb waiter. Yes he did.",This room is too big. I’m used to small boxes. I don’t know if I can sleep in a room this big.,"Well, we have a broom closet down the hall that might be suitable.","I’m allergic to dust, so I guess I’ll have to put up with this place.",I’ll see you downstairs when you’re ready.
680717__revenge-inc,"So tell me about this business you started, Lynn.","We call it Revenge, Inc. We find people who are being abused or cheated and set things right.",How do you do that?,"Well, it depends on what the offender has done. If a deadbeat dad is refusing to pay alimony and child report, I dig into his accounts and see if he is hiding assets from the court.",Then what do you do?,"Well, I found a dad recently who had half a million dollars in a hidden account while his ex-wife and kids were barely getting by. So I took some of his money and had Rick put it in an annuity that provided them with a monthly check, and would have enough left over to pay for the kids college when they graduated from high school.",Why didn’t you just report it to the court?,"Because it would take months to get the judge to act, and the man’s lawyers would probably get him off the hook. His family would be no better off","When you say you took some of his money, I presume that you hacked into his hidden account to make that happen?","I’ll need immunity from prosecution to answer that, Matt.","Oh, come on Lynn. I know what you do isn’t squeaky clean. And as long as you’re playing Robin Hood I have no problem with it. But please tell me you never have or never will use it for personal gain.","Matt, we’re multimillionaires . . . from legitimate sources. We don’t need any more money. As a matter of fact, we use our own assets to fund our work – and to help people out if we can’t get it from the offender.",You’re shi . . . you’re kidding me. Are you serious?,I can show you our financial records and tax returns if you like.,"No, no. I don’t need to see them. It’s just that it’s so hard believe. I mean, you’re all so ordinary, down to earth. I don’t see a bit of rich snobbery like the Philadelphia blue bloods flaunt.",That’s because we only acquired our money several months ago. We didn’t grow up as spoiled rich brats.,"This changes how I look at you. I mean, being in the presence of a multimillionaire – I don’t know how to act.",Get over it! I’m still the Lynn you enjoy being with. Nothing’s changed. Pretend I’m from a poor coal miner’s family – which I am by the way – who will always let you pick up the tab. Forget I ever told you about the money. That’s why I didn’t tell you earlier. I didn’t want to scare you off.,Okay. I can do that. If I get out of hand smack me on the back of the head to straighten up my thinking.,There. Did that reset your thinking?,Yes ma’am.
680717__revenge-inc,Whoo hoo! It worked. We won.,Well . . . are you going to let me in on it.,"Now I understand what you guys do, and I think it’s terrific. What you did for that family is . . ."
680717__revenge-inc,"This calls for a celebratory meal. We have some thick steaks in the fridge, and I’m sure Harriet and Lynn can come up with some mouth-watering side dishes. I’ll get the fire started. Matt, put a coat on and join me on the deck.",Isn’t Rick wonderful. He knows we can’t wait to talk about things so he’s giving us some space.,Would you like to drive up to Jack’s cabin this morning?,Sure. Is there a reason we’re going there?,I’ve got a few remaining ghosts I need to deal with – memories from up there I need to make peace with.,"Are you sure you want to go up there, Lynn. You have some pretty scary memories about the place.","No, I’m okay with it. I’ll have two men watching over me; Matt and Jack.",So this the place where Jack saved you from the car bomb. What else happened up there?,Just a couple of quick exits when some bad people came after us. I’ll fill you in while we’re driving there.,I can’t wait. You’re finally going to tell all. I have been hoping you would let your guard down and tell me more about your amazing adventures.,I didn’t say I would tell all. There are some things you don’t need to know. But I’ll give up most of it.,Great. When do we leave?,How about an hour? And dress warmly. It gets pretty chilly up in those mountains.,Cold enough for long johns?,That would be good.
680717__revenge-inc,That’s enough about me. On the way back you can tell me all the bad stuff you’ve gotten into.,"This is amazing – mountains covered with a pristine forest of hardwoods and evergreens, set behind a glass smooth lake. It doesn’t get better than this.",I’ll start the generator to get some electricity. Why don’t you get a fire going. The wood is stacked outside the back door.
680717__revenge-inc,"What, are you afraid I’ll bite? Come on over here and put your arm around me.",Ummm. That’s better. Jack and I used to snuggle here for hours talking – or just sitting silently. Those kind of moments strengthened the bond between us.
680717__revenge-inc,I’m hungry. How about a sandwich?,Is it too cold to eat out on the porch,Not if you’re wearing your long johns.,"Yes, I took your advice and came prepared.","Quite often we see wild animals out there – raccoons, squirrels, deer, bears, and eagles. And tons of cardinals. I love their pretty singing. I’m good at imitating their call with a whistle. Sometimes I carry on conversations with them.",So among your many other talents you talk to birds? What do you talk about?,"Oh, mostly about the weather, and where the lady cardinals might pick up a bright scarlet male. . . . No, not really. I was making up that last part. But I do wonder what a cardinal thinks I’m saying with my whistles.",I knew you were kidding about the bird conversation. But I wasn’t really certain. You do so many other things well I thought it might be possible for you to discuss things with them.,I should have kept you guessing. How about a tour of the place?,Great. And I want to start by following Jack’s string of wireless video cameras to where he got the bears to attack the guys spying on him.
680717__revenge-inc,Now you know everything about my secret hideaway in the mountains.,Do you come here often?,Only a couple of times recently. It’s a six-hour drive from Philly. But now that I’m closer I expect to spend more time up here. The peace resets my stress level to nearly zero.,"We better get out of here before the rain hits, Matt. These mountain roads can be treacherous in the rain. You put the leftover groceries in the truck while I turn the alarm system back on."
680717__revenge-inc,You think we can move these rocks?,Not unless you’re looking forward to back surgery.,"So, what now?",How long will it take the road maintenance people to get up here to clear it?,With this rain there will be similar problems throughout the county. Since this is a seldom-traveled road we’re pretty low on the priority list. I think we’ll be lucky if they even get to it tomorrow.,What’s Plan B?,"I don’t have a Plan B. We could try taking the back road out behind the cabin, but we’d be sliding downhill on muddy roads most of he way. So that’s not really an option.",How about Plan C. Can we get someone up here with a bulldozer?,"No, they would have to bring it up on a flatbed, and no one will try that in this weather. So unless there was one up here already for construction or road work, there’s no way. . . . Wait! There is one up here. Jack has a Bobcat with a front-end loader parked in the barn. It’s a lightweight as dozers go, but I think it can handle these rocks.","That should work, but by the time we get back up there it will already be getting dark. We’ll have to wait until morning – and hope the rain is gone by then.",Alright. We can’t do anything about it tonight. I get the top bunk.,"You have bunk beds? . . . Oh, you’re putting me on again. I’ll get used to it. What about food. We might squeeze one more sandwich out of the lunch leftovers, but that won’t be enough.","Not to worry. Jack has a freezer stuffed with trout and deer meat. Or, you being an old military man, I have some MREs that might appeal to you. What does that stand for, anyway?","There are lots of ugly names attached to that acronym by the soldiers who have to eat them, but the official army name is Meals – comma – Ready to Eat.",Why not Ready to Eat Meals? It would save all that ink it takes to print the commas.,"It’s the military. There’s a sign over the entrance to the Pentagon that reads ‘Abandon All Logic and Reason, Ye Who Enter Here.’","Now you’re putting me on. There isn’t really a sign like that, is there?","No, but there might as well be.",The Bobcat is over there in the barn. Let’s go check it out to make sure it still runs. I don’t think it’s been started in over a year.
680717__revenge-inc,There’s the Bobcat over in the corner.,"Jack had a liking for big boys toys, didn’t he. A snowmobile, a jet ski, a lawn tractor, and . . . what’s that over there.",That’s his hang glider. He planned to modify it by adding a small jet engine but he didn’t get around to it before . . . before he was killed. Climb into the Bobcat and see if you can start it.,It seems like the battery is dead. We’ll have to charge it before we can take it out.,Jack keeps a couple of spare batteries on a trickle charger in the back room. They should be good to go.
680717__revenge-inc,"I need to get a fire started in the living room, but I can’t go in there dripping water and mud.",Me neither. Turn your back while I get out of my sweatshirt and jeans so I can get us some towels. You strip to your long johns and get the fire going.,Your not serious?,Yes I am. Now turn your back while I undress. When you hear the bedroom door slam you can start stripping.
680717__revenge-inc,What’s so funny?,"I’ve been imagining what you would look like in nothing but your long johns, and now I know.",I must be pretty funny looking to make you laugh so hard.,"No, not at all Matt. But you do look like a Norman Rockwell painting.","Let me have one of those towels so I can dry off. I’m glad you like me in my long underwear, but I can’t stay in these. They need to dry out. But I’ve got nothing else to put on.",I’ll get a set of Jack’s flannel pajamas and a robe from the bedroom. Then we can wash our clothes so they’ll be clean and dry by morning. Come with me and let’s find you some warm pajamas and a robe.,"This stuff is great, Lynn. Where did you learn to make it?",From my skiing days. Have you ever skied?,I haven’t ever lived anywhere near a ski resort.,The Snowshoe Mountain Ski Resort is about fifty miles south of here. Maybe we can try it out next winter.,I’d like that.,How about some supper. What sounds good to you?,"You choose, Lynn. Something easy.","Okay. Since I have never tasted an MRE, let’s have a couple of those. What flavor is best?","I think all of them are made of the same stuff. They figure if they put the right food coloring and scent in it, and label it beef and noodles, or chicken and dumpling, that’s what soldiers will taste when they eat it.",Do they offer a good Italian pasta with marinara sauce and Chianti on the side?,"There’s something close to that, but you’ll have to provide the Chianti.","This is so pleasant, Matt.",What? Sitting in front of the fire?,"No, the closeness of sitting here with your arm around me. You aren’t really a romantic, are you Matt.","What man is? If a guy says he’s a romantic, I think he’s just telling his woman what she wants to hear.","No, I disagree. I’ll accept that it takes awhile being together with a woman he loves, but if he’s willing to climb out of the macho box our culture puts him in, I think most men will find their romantic core and enjoy a much deeper relationship.",One can always hope.
680717__revenge-inc,"Bedtime, huh.","Yeah, I was drifting in and out of sleep. We’d better turn in so we can get an early start on clearing the road.","May I, um, kiss you goodnight?","You may, sir.","That’s not a kiss, silly. Here’s a kiss."
680717__revenge-inc,"This has been a wonderfully enjoyable day, Lynn. I hope we can share some more.","Oh, we will. Definitely."
680717__revenge-inc,Matt! . . . Matt! . . .  are you okay?,Lynn?,Thank God it’s you. I almost shot you. I heard a gunshot? Did Zarah take a shot at you?,"It was just a crack of lightning outside, Lynn. I think it might have hit a tree up on the hill behind us. No one is going to harm you.","I thought Zarah was coming for me, Matt. And I wasn’t ready for her.",It’s okay. There’s nothing to be afraid of. I’m here for you.
680717__revenge-inc,I’m sorry. I didn’t expect you to see me like this. It’s all I had to sleep in.,There’s no need to apologize. That image will stay with me for a long time.,"Well, the glimpse I had of you in oversized plaid flannel pajamas hopefully will fade quickly."
680717__revenge-inc,Did you have any trouble moving the rockslide?,"No, Lynn’s a wizard with the Bobcat. She had it cleared in twenty minutes."
680717__revenge-inc,"That’s alright, you’re forgiven for having your mind in the gutter.",Now you’ve really made me feel bad.,There’s nothing to talk about. We just shared a pleasant evening in front of the fire followed by separate sleeping arrangements.,"Yeah, right.",It looks like you’ve been busy mowing grass already. That’s one reason I’m glad I live in an apartment. That’s a lot of lawn – how long does it take you?,"I have a small tractor with an eight-foot cutting deck, so it doesn’t usually take more than an hour.","With that thick hedge surrounding the property no one can see what shape your lawn is in, so why mow it?","Because I can see it, and I like neat.","Speaking of seeing in, I saw a vehicle parked outside the fence while I was mowing. They left after I passed them a couple of times.",Could it be your neighbors?
680717__revenge-inc,What kind of vehicle was it!,"I couldn’t really tell looking through the hedge, but I think it was a light colored late model SUV.","It wasn’t a black pickup, was it?","No, that would have gotten my attention since you told me Zarah drives a black Avalanche.",I hate it having to live looking over my shoulder all the time. I wish I had killed her in that warehouse.,You barely escaped with you life. Be thankful for that.,You’re right. . . but I can’t get her off my mind.,Remind me again why she is so driven to kill you?,"Okay, Matt. Since we seem to be headed for a close relationship I’ll tell you the truth. It could send me to prison, but I trust you not to act on it. In detective jargon it’s off the record and hypothetical, got that?",Yes ma’am.,Got that?,"You can trust us with your life, Lynn. We’re all family."
680717__revenge-inc,So Alexei drowned at the bottom of a remote lake in northern Wisconsin?,"Maybe. I told him as I shut the car door that, as tightly sealed as HumVees are, I wasn’t sure whether he would run out of air or freeze to death first.",Did you actually see the Hummer go through the ice?,"No, I was out of sight when I heard the explosion.","So you don’t know for sure if Alexei is really dead, do you.",I don’t see how he could have survived. . . . But I suppose it’s possible.,"Well, it appears to me that, since you didn’t actually witness the car sinking into the lake, we can’t say for sure that he’s dead. So all we really have here is a missing persons case, and there’s no crime in that.","I like the way you think, Detective Murdoch. I believe I’ll keep you around for awhile."
680717__revenge-inc,Did you know that about sixty tons of space dust falls on the earth each day? It comes from meteor trails and particles attracted by the earth’s gravity.,We have our own Matt Nye the Science Guy among us. What other amazing scientific facts can you regale us with?,That was about it. And I don’t even know where I picked it up.,So how many years will it take the earth to double in size from the falling stardust?,"Oh, I would guess a hundred million billion years.","I take it math wasn’t your strong suit in college, huh Matt.",Math . . . what’s that?,I can guarantee that it won’t take more than five billion years.,And how do you know that?,Because that’s when scientists predict the sun will burn out. I heard it on the Science Channel.
680717__revenge-inc,What was that. It sounded like it was in front of the house.,It’s Zarah coming to get me.,"Into the house, everyone. Get your hands on some weapons, quick."
680717__revenge-inc,Kill all the lights and lock the doors. Now!,"Everyone get to a window. If you see someone with a gun, shoot ‘em. Shout out how many you see.",I have two moving in on the front door.
680717__revenge-inc,"I have three big pickups out front with six attackers. . . . They’re spreading out around the house. Two of them are heading around back. Heads up, Harriet!",Same for the front door. Why are they waiting?,Sniper on one of the pick ups. Stay out of sight. . . . It looks like he’s got a night vision scope!,Who are they shooting at. Anyone hit. Everyone check in.,Lynn here. I’m clear.,Harriet. I’m good. . . . Rick . . . Rick! . . . Answer  me!,Stay there Harriet. I’ll go down and check on him. Rick? . . .,"I’m hit, but I can still shoot. Move me so I can cover the front door.","Rick’s good. They missed. Come on in, you bastards. I got some lead waiting for you.","We’re outgunned, Matt. They can wait us out until we use all our ammo.","We’re just have to make our shots count. Six of them, three dozen shots between us. We can make it work.",RPG incoming!! Get down!
680717__revenge-inc,"Rick, are you okay?",Yeah. I’m still here.,Give me some covering fire – I’m coming down.,Where you been?
680717__revenge-inc,"Five down, one to go. Anyone in back?",Lynn’s out the door with nothing in sight.,Damn her. That’s a stupid thing to do.
680717__revenge-inc,"What are you doing, Matt! There’s still one out there.",If they haven’t run yet we’re safer in the house. He looked over at Harriet. “Rick’s been hit. Lets all go to the living room.,"Rick. . . . Rick! . . . She felt his neck for a pulse and found one, but it wasn’t very strong. She looked up at Matt and Lynn. “He’s unconscious.","Do you think the last one is gone, Matt?’ He turned to answer her and saw a flash of motion up on the balcony. Lynn looked up. “Zarah! . . . How did you get up there?","Someone gave me some smoke for cover and Rick over there was already out, so I just walked right in. Now it’s time for you to pay."
680717__revenge-inc,We need to get busy figuring out how to get the house repaired as soon as possible – to make it livable.,It’s livable now if we eat fast food. We should be able to get a new stove and refrigerator in here pretty quick.,"No, we should wait on that until they repair all the shrapnel holes in the walls and ceiling. It will be quicker for the workmen without those things in the way.","Yeah, I guess you’re right. We’ll be staying in a motel for the next few weeks. I’m willing to pay whatever it takes to get a contractor in here who can guarantee the job will be completed in a month or less. Do you know anyone Harriet?"
680717__revenge-inc,"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you . . . what’s your name?",Elaine.,Times a’wasting Lynn. Come on.
680717__revenge-inc,"All I can tell you ma’am is what the board shows. When the doctors know more, one of them will come out and speak with you.",What about his surgeon . . .  this Dr. Burns. Is he any good?,"I can’t answer that either Mrs. Goodman. But I can tell you this. If it were my husband on the operating table, Dr. Burns is the only one I would let touch him."
680717__revenge-inc,"Lord, this man has become very special to me. Sometimes I wonder if it was you that brought us together. But I love him! That’s the first time I’ve used that word about him. I just now realized that I do love him. Lord, I ask you to watch over him. Guide the surgeon’s hands. Strengthen Matt to withstand the operation and bring him through it safely. And strengthen me to get through this. Please Lord!",May we pray with you?,"Oh, yes. Please do.",Is it your husband in surgery?,"No, but he’s a man that I love, and I want to spend my life with him. His name is Matt."
680717__revenge-inc,We’ll wait with you if you don’t mind.,Of course I don’t mind. I’m just so thankful you came and prayed with me. Fear is hard to handle when you’re alone. Who are you here waiting for?,"No one. We come here, and to other hospitals, whenever we can and reach out to those who need closeness to God."
680717__revenge-inc,"Mr. Murdock was in extremely serious condition when he was brought in. He suffered major organ damage to his liver, right lung, and stomach, with bullet fragments puncturing the small intestine in several places. Whoever shot him was using fragmenting bullets, which is why the damage is so extensive. We have repaired some of the damage to the liver and lung, and stopped the bleeding for now. If he survives we will repair the rest of the damage with subsequent operations.",If he survives?? What do you mean?,"In cases with this much damage to several organs, the body sometimes shuts down, gives up. We can’t fix that.",Can I see him now? Can I talk to him?,He is unconscious now and may be for a few days. When he is able to have visitors someone will call you. You left your number at the front desk?,Good. That’s all we need.,Trust in Me
680717__revenge-inc,I’ll get someone up here this afternoon to get these broken windows boarded up. We don’t want water damage to add to the mess.,"That’s the first thing, definitely. While you’re doing that I’ll line us up a couple of motels.",Maybe we can both stay somewhere halfway in between the two hospitals. There’s an Embassy Suites in Tysons Corner that’s pretty nice. It would be less than thirty minutes either way.
680717__revenge-inc,Stop it Lynn! Those are terrible thoughts. Don’t let your mind go there.,"Lord, please bring him through it so we can have many more pleasant memories together. If You did bring us together, I have to believe You wouldn’t take him away so soon."
680717__revenge-inc,Grab yourself the drink of your choice at the bar. Drinks are free until six o’clock. And the good thing is they’re so watered down we can’t get drunk. What did they tell you?,"You first, Harriet.",The spokesman – it wasn’t even a doctor – told me that nothing had changed and I couldn’t see him because he was still in a coma. How about Matt?,"You must have talked to the twin of the spokesperson I got. Same story. I got the impression he didn’t want to be bothered. The ole ‘don’t call me, I’ll call you if there’s any change’ story.",So what do we do now.,I’m going up to our room and use every internet resource I can find to learn about medical treatment for patients in Matt’s situation. Maybe I’ll find a ray of hope.,I’ll join you. I never heard of a collapsed circulatory system before.,"Maybe my idea wasn’t so great, Harriet. I need something to take my mind off Matt, not depress me.",And do what? Bring them up here?,"No, we’ll just play with them awhile at the bar, get their hopes up, then go to the ladies room and disappear.","That could be fun, but I would only go after the ones with wedding rings. They deserve to be played.","Seriously, what could we do to distract ourselves.",Maybe you could teach me some of your simpler hacking tricks. We could be here for days with lots of time to kill.,"I like that. Then I’ll have someone to help me with the Revenge hacking when we get too busy for me to handle it all. Let me get our computers talking to each other so your screen is a copy of mine. I’ll go through each procedure a step at a time while you watch, and I’ll have your computer record it so you can practice on your own.","Lesson one. How to back out of a hack in a millisecond, before they start backtracking to your computer.","Hello, this is Lynn Preston.","Mrs. Preston, we have some news about Mr. Murdock . . .","Well, go ahead. I can take it.",He has regained consciousness. He’s apparently quite a fighter and fought his way back into our world.,Can I visit him? Now. Today?,"Yes you may, but the visits must be limited to five minutes for now. He tires easily.",Harriet! Harriet! Matt’s awake! He’s awake.,"Yes. Yes. I’m going right now! You forgot something. I’m sure Matt wouldn’t mind, but you’re still in your pajamas.","Oh . . . yeah. I have to get some nice clothes and make up on. I don’t want him to see me like this. You too, Harriet. Get dressed and come with me!",Is he awake now? Can we talk to him?,"Yes on both counts, but not until the doctor finishes examining him. Have a seat. I’ll let you know.",Five minutes only. I’ll tap on the glass when your time is up.,Matt. Matt? It’s me . . . Lynn.,Lynn. . . . Lynn. Now I know I really am alive. I kept wondering if I was dead and everything was a dream.,You couldn’t have been dead. Dead people don’t dream.,"I’m sorry, dear. No more funny things. We only have a couple more minutes. I brought Harriet with me.","How’s Rick, Harriet.",He’s still unconscious – in a coma. He lost too much blood. They don’t know when he will come out of it.,"I’m so sorry for you and Rick. But he’ll pull through, just like I did. I prayed for you, darling.",I know.,"Come on, you have to meet these people. This is the couple I told you about, the ones who prayed with me.","Harriet, this is . . . I’m sorry I never asked who you were.",I’m Michael and this is Angelina.,My friend Matt is awake and talking. I just spoke with him.,We know. We’ve been praying for him.,"Thank you, and God, so much. For praying and staying with me when I was crushed.",You must be Lynn’s friend. It’s nice that you came along to support her.,"Actually, she and her husband need prayer, badly. He was seriously injured at the same time as Matt and is in the Loudoun Hospital in Leesburg. He’s in a coma and may not survive. Can you pray for him?","Of course. Dear Lord, you have answered my prayers and I thank you and praise you for it. But its Harriet and Rick who now need your healing hand. Please give the doctors the skill they need to bring him back to us. Strengthen his body so it can rebuild itself and heal."
680717__revenge-inc,"God, I don’t know you as well as I should, but I met Christ when I was twelve years old, and I hear that He will never let me out of His hand. I ask now, in His name, that You heal my husband, that You bring him back to me. I don’t care if he’s not all there, I just want him back. And thank you for bringing us to these two Godly people Lord. I’m sure you know them much better than you know me, so even if my prayers are having trouble reaching you, I’m certain that you can hear theirs.",We have others waiting in there. He looked Harriet straight in the eyes and said firmly “Trust God!
680717__revenge-inc,When do we leave?,Maybe we can all go.
680717__revenge-inc,"Look, the fish are jumping. Maybe we can get some fishing in while we’re here. What are they, trout?",Yes. Jack fished often. He didn’t care if he caught anything. He used the time for what he called his heavy duty thinking. He left us a freezer full of fish if you don’t want to go to the trouble of catching them.,"I used to fish as a boy, but the thrill of the catch is probably gone at my age.",I think dinner is about ready. Let’s go in and feast on the special of the day.,"Same stuff, different day. I’m about ready to turn in, how about you?","This sure feels good, but I guess I’m ready.","This time together has been unbelievably enjoyable, Matt. Can we sleep together when we get back to The Farm?",Whatever will Harriet and Rick think of us?,"What they’re most likely already thinking, dear.","You know, that bothers me a little – them thinking we’re doing more than sleeping together. Do you think you could let Harriet know we’re almost there, but have decided to wait? Would that embarrass you?","Heavens no. That’s how Jack and I played it before we were married, and Harriet knows it.","What do you think our future will be, Matt?","Well, I . . . I don’t want to be apart from you, but I have to go back to the detective division in Philadelphia.","Why? You can be an investigator for Revenge, Inc. Then we can live at The Farm full time, even work from the cabin whenever we feel like it.","I don’t know, Lynn. . . . It’s like I have to prove I’m back at a hundred per cent – show them that I’m not crippled by my injuries. I had the doctor forward my latest medical results to the department. Before I can return to duty, the department medical staff will have to study them and pronounce me fit for duty.",Okay. I understand that. . . . I’ll look into to moving the business back to the city.,"No, don’t do that, Lynn. You love it out at The Farm, and you need Rick and Harriet to help with the business. I’ll come back every Friday night and stay ‘til early Monday morning. And I’ll spend all my holidays and vacation here with you.",When do you leave?,After the weekend. On Monday morning.,It is what it is. I can live with it. I’ll take every minute with you I can get.,"Well, we have three more days – and nights. Let’s get back to The Farm and start enjoying them.","I’ll call you tonight, sweetheart, and every night.",I’ll look forward to it.
680717__revenge-inc,"Welcome back, Matt. Come on in my office and let’s talk.","Have a seat. Damn you’re looking good! I expected . . . I, uh . . . . Hell, it’s good to see you.","I have the report from the medical review board here, Matt, and I have good news. They have authorized a medical retirement – with full pay. You won’t have to keep working to get your twenty-five years in.","Well, don’t just sit there. Say something.","I never expected this, Captain . . . I . . . I thought . . . I planned to . . .","I don’t know what to think, Captain Whittaker. This is great.","Well, you earned every bit of it. You were the best detective we had back in the day.","We have a full dress retirement ceremony set up the day after tomorrow, with the band and everything.","You know me, Captain. I never liked those things – Christmas parties, Friday afternoon beer call, social gatherings. I really don’t want a retirement ceremony. I hope you understand.",I thought you might feel that way. It will be no problem to cancel it. This is the Philadelphia Police Department Medal for Bravery. If you did the ceremony the mayor would have pinned it on your uniform. But this way all you get is me and a handshake.,"I’d rather have it from you any day, Captain."
680717__revenge-inc,What’s wrong?,Nothing’s wrong. Everything’s just the way it should be.
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,Flynnie!!!,"That you, Babe?",Yeah. Want me to come up?,Right down.,"Max, beer!"
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,"Men suck, Flynnie.","I know, Babe. We’re bastards.","Don’t say that! That’s just so damn easy for you guys. You say ‘hey, what did you expect, I’m an asshole’ like that’s some kind of an excuse.","Well, it is an excuse. A lousy excuse but an excuse all the same.","Flynnie, this guy worked harder to get me to fall for him than any guy I’ve ever met. I tried so hard not to make the same mistake I made the last time but look what happened!",What happened?,He’s going back to his wife.,Yeah? Sounds like you got a better deal than she did.,"That doesn’t help, Flynnie.","No, I don’t suppose it does.","Why did he do it, Flynnie? Why would he chase me like he did and then turn around and do this? I don’t get it. What’s wrong with me.","You know better than to ask that. There’s nothing wrong with you. You’re smart, you’re pretty, you’re a good artist, you’ve got those big knockers.","Let me tell you something, being pretty and having big knockers isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.",No? I don’t think very many people—male or female—would agree with you on that. I see how the guys in here look at you when you come around. There are a lot of women who would love to have guys look at them like that.
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,"You know what, Flynnie, that’s just bullshit.",It is not bullshit. There are girls half your age in town who wish they got the attention you do.,So what? So what if guys look at my boobs and my whatever else they look at. It doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t mean they love me or even like me. It just means I have big boobs. Big deal. It’s not like they’ve done me any good!,I’m serious. I’ve had these monsters since I was fifteen. I’ve been hauling them around for almost twenty-five years now and all they’ve done is make my life miserable. And now they’re starting to go south! Why the hell would anyone want this?,I never thought of it that way.,"Well, why would you?",I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be gross.,You weren’t gross.,I just want to be happy. All my life I’ve dreamed about having a nice guy and a nice home and maybe some kids. What’s so wrong about that?,"There’s nothing wrong with it, Babe, it’s just not right for everyone. Being married and having kids is for people who don’t want to do anything else.",Why aren’t you married?,I have been. I’m just no good at it.,Really?,"Well, let me rephrase that. I’m real good at getting married. I’m just no good at staying married.",You’ve been married more than once?,You’re kidding me?,Why?,But... no kids?,No. No kids—none of the marriages lasted very long.,What happened?,For what it’s worth they all left me. Not the other way around.,I can’t believe you. You’re such a nice guy. I can’t imagine anyone leaving you.,You know Suze Crawley that works at the post office?,"Sure, of course."
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,She was my second wife. Ready for another?,"Flynnie, I think you and Suze would be good together.",I thought so too.,But?,She said I was too romantic. Lots of women like that idea in theory but they find it hard to live with.,Because you write poetry?
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,"Naw. She always liked my poems. She thought I’d be a great poet someday. No. I’m not sure what it was, really. She said being my Muse was too hard. To tell the truth, I never knew what she meant by that. Suze is a beautiful woman. I didn’t think I ever expected anything more from her than letting me love her for that.",beautiful,How long ago was that?,"Ten years, maybe. It always took me more time to get over a woman than I actually spent with her. Figure that out.",Did you write a poem about her?,"Every poem I wrote was about her—well, while I was with her. It was like that with all of them..."
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,"Come on, Max. Don’t be scared. I’m here.",Damn. Danny Choate and I were going to go diving for lobsters in the morning. Now the floor will be too murky. I’d say business is closed for this night—we’ll be losing power soon. Want to come upstairs and I’ll fix us some supper?,Sure.
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,"Make yourself at home? You don’t mind lobster, do you? I can make an omelet.","Flynnie, for most people lobster is a treat. We don’t live on it all summer.",Most people don’t go diving every few days.,Yeah. Lobster-diving isn’t a popular sport in Kentucky.,No wonder you left it. Why do people live in places like that?,"One of these days, I’m going to rig up a way to run the CD player on lamp oil."
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,Are you staying?,I guess so.,"Here, you get first turn in the bathroom."
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,Sweet dreams.,Flynnie. do you love me?,Yes. I do.,Why haven’t you ever said that to me before?,Good question. I guess because I know that you’re still looking for Mr. Wonderful and I ain’t him. And I’m tired of getting my heart broken.,"Oh, Flynnie.","Go to sleep, Babe.",No. I don’t want to keep pretending nothing happens when we’re together. I don’t want to wake up in an empty bed tomorrow.,"When you pretend something doesn’t happen, it makes it easier when it stops happening.","You’re a beautiful man, Flynnie. You’re the most beautiful man I know.",I’m going to make everything alright. I’m going to make sure you never get up and leave me again.
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,How wonderful. How long will we be gone?,A week maybe. We can fly down for the party and spend a few days with them and then I’ll show you New Orleans. You’ll love New Orleans.,home,Yes. Can we eat in sidewalk cafes and go to jazz clubs?,We can hardly avoid it.,Can we stay in the French Quarter?

No sense in them going to waste.",Well....,An empty frying pan means a sunny day tomorrow.,"Well, I’ll just eat them as a community service then. Effie Parnell likes to hang her wash out on Thursdays and gets damn cranky if the sun ain’t shining.","So, what’s Old Bruno think about this being a cyber-café now? ka-FEE",I don’t think Pa has any idea what the internet is. He just knows it makes money and that’s good enough for him.
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,"How’s the old reprobate doin, anyway?",Not good. He hasn’t been downstairs in weeks now. I keep telling him he should see a doctor but you know him.,I sure do. All Bruno’s problems can be found in one place - the bottom of a rum bottle.,You could go up and see him. Might do him some good to talk to someone besides me.,Some other time. You tell him I was askin after him though.,Excuse me.,Sign out front says you dress out deer here.,That’s right. You fellas get lucky?,"One guy in our group, so far, what’s it going to cost him to have you take care of it?",Depends. We can just dress it out for you or cut it up and package it or...,"Says here you can store the meat, too.","Yeah, we have a big walk-in freezer downstairs. Some folks don’t have room for a whole deer at home.",Can I take this with me?,Sure.,"You ain’t cuttin up them deer by yourself, are ya?",Nope. I used to but I got Porky Heinz coming in whenever I need him to do the skinning and butchering. He was working at the IGA up there in Binghamton till his mama got sick and he come home to look after her. He’s a pretty good butcher.,"Good thinkin. You got your hands full runnin this place now that Old Bruno’s taken to his bed. Place looks real good, I have to say.",Yeah. Business is growing. We got a lot a hunters up from Philly and Baltimore this year. City boys tryin to have an ‘authentic’ wilderness experience.
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,Glad to see you doin so well. I used to worry about you and Old Bruno bein stuck out here so far in the woods alone but it looks like you’re doin jest fine.,Sorry to bother you again.,No bother.,Do you have any 7mm cartridges? Remington Magnum.,I’ll look.,What you huntin with?,"It’s a custom-built, bolt-action.",Got one a them built-in range finders in the scope?,Yes.,Figgers.,Sorry. All I have is 30.06.,"Naw, that’s okay. I think I’ve got enough for now. Do you have any pies left?",Just Dutch apple and lemon meringue. I’ll have fresh ones tomorrow.,Wrap up an apple for me.,Don’t tell me I’m too late for a piece a your mincemeat pie today?,I keep the mincemeat in the kitchen. It’s just for my favorite regulars. Too much work to make it for everybody.,Your momma made the best homemade mincemeat pies I ever had in my life. She musta passed her pie-making genes on to you.,You fellas just like the mincemeat because of all the booze in it. Mama used a good amount of suet in her mincemeat. It helps marry all them spices. I’ve got plenty of suet.,"Well, if Porky’s makin deer sausage I reckon he’s butcherin some pigs, too.",Something like that.,I can’t hardly b’lieve you can cook like she done. You was just a little kid when she passed on.,I was ten.
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,It’s a wonder you was old enough to remember.,I started helping her when I was old enough to stand. Pa had me stuffing sausages when I was big enough to reach the grinder. I made them sausages you’re eating now.,"Well, they’re fine. It’s a wonder you have the time to run this store and do all the cookin and still take care a your old man. Harry Jenkins says he and the missus drive out here every Sunday after services just so’s they can have some of your mincemeat pie.","Yeah, him and Barty Hollaway used to come out to play pinochle with Pa. Whitey Pringle, too. I made Reverend Jenkins take them each a couple pounds of sausage and a pie just this past Sunday.","Ain’t you a sweetheart! I ‘member some of those card games. I filled in often enough. You was always lurkin around - skinny kid with those big, wide eyes a yours... Bringin us sandwiches and pie. You was so obligin."
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,Looks like more snow.,Never know what will happen during a long winter.,Your Pa sure is lucky to have you. Don’t know what he’d do being sick and all way out here in the middle of nowhere. I’m real glad you worked things out with him. I recall a few years back you wasn’t too happy here.
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,"Well, all that’s changed now. I turned eighteen and can sign the checks and keep the store running. If Pa kicks the bucket over the winter I’ll just stick him down in the meat locker until Spring.",You do that. You got room for two-hundred and seventy pounds of useless meat down there?,"Yes, I do.",You know. Your father always loved you.,"I know. Only thing I worry about is that he’ll get up in the middle of the night and try to go hunting again. He hasn’t done that in some time and I always found him and brought him back but if he were to go out when I was sleeping, well, who knows what could happen?",We got SUVs now and cell phones down to the station. If anything happens all you gotta do is call.,"We’ll be fine. Frankly, I think this is going to be a real good winter. Hunters are already starting to bring in deer to be processed and I’ve got a lot of plans for the store here. I might start having some of the ladies in town bake pies for me and Porky comes in when I need him. But don’t worry... I’ll still make sausages and mincemeat pies with my own hands just for Pa’s special friends.","You’re a good girl, honey. Still takin care of us and all.",Glad to. I put aside a whole shelf full of meat downstairs that I’m keeping special just for you boys.,You ready for that mincemeat pie? With a nice scoop of ice cream on it?,"You bet, honey, you bet.","The secret to making mincemeat, is to make sure the suet you use has been soaked in liquor for a good long time."

What’s a cute girl like you doing with a homely bastard like this?",Watch the mouth.,"Just lucky, I guess.",Clair’s gonna join the crew. When we get our boat she’s going to be first mate.,Not a chance. Women and boats don’t go together. We might be crazy but we aren’t dumb enough to take a woman on board.,Crazy is right. You clowns are going to lose your shirts and wind up working for me like Dante.,"This is my brother-in-law, Costas is married to our sister Rafaella. He has a crappy little painting company with our idiota brother.",Dante is proud of the car he’s been able to buy working for you.,At least one of these pig-headed Romeo’s has some sense. These two think they’re going to buy a boat and make some money.,"We are gonna buy a boat. It’s a beauty, too. A one piece welded steel tug built over in Dover at Gamble in the forties. It’s been completely re-outfitted and converted to diesel. Nice little trawler. There’s still plenty of perch and walleyes out there waiting for some decent fishermen to catch them.","Yeah, the lake’s a long ways from being fished out. We’ve been bringing in white bass and perch. More guys are bringing in herring all the time, you have to know to go where the fish are. That’s why me and Tony and Mario are the men for the job, we can stay out and work the nets like most of these guys that call themselves fishermen have never seen.","Did you know, that when the first pioneers came to Lake Erie the fish were so plentiful they couldn’t even row boats because of all the fish? They used to get their women to scoop them up in baskets and they’d load them on wagons and throw them in their fields to fertilize the crops.",I can’t imagine that.,It’s true. The Indians mostly didn’t catch fish. They were afraid of the lake.,Afraid of the lake?,Yup. The Iroquois thought a demon lived in the depths of the lake and they wouldn’t even make camp near it.,Yeah. They’d travel in parties out the peninsula because they thought the demon couldn’t see them there and they’d set up seine nets and catch fish to take back to their villages to dry but they wouldn’t go out on the Lake for anything.,How do you know all this?,"You should hear the old timers sometime, Clair. They tell some pretty damn wild stories about being caught out in the central basin during a muzzler and seeing an Iroquois war party appear out of the mist.",I’d like that. I’m interested in old stories like that. Back home we call it ‘yarn-spinning’.,"Well, then I’ll have to take you down to Walks-in-the-Water some night. You’ll hear all the stories you want.",What’s Walks-in-the-Water?,Sal’s tavern.,Sal Testaverde. He’s Mario’s older brother—more like his father really. He has a tavern down on Canal Street by the docks. Lots of old timers hang out in there. Sal named it Walks-in-the-Water because that’s what the Iroquois called the first steam ship when they saw it.,Really?
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,"Yeah. You’ll like Sal. He’s a tough old buzzard. Sal used to work the lakers way back when. He walked away from one of the worst storms ever, came ashore and said he wasn’t ever going back out for anything. He bought the Walks-in-the-Water and won’t even talk about fishing. We’ll go down there sometime with Mario and Gia.",I can’t wait.

I used to play baseball with Dante at St. Stanislaus Prep.,Clair Wagner. I never met these people before tonight.,Yeah? How’d that happen? You and your friend don’t look like the kind of girls I usually see at these parties.,"You won’t believe it. One minute I was safe in my dorm room at Chesterton and then the next thing you know I made a wish on a Christmas angel and Pio was picking me up off the sidewalk, literally.",No kidding. Pio must be improving his technique. I’ve been to a few parties out at Chesterton. I’m at Hamilton but I live with my folks out by Girard.,You don’t look like a fisherman.,No thanks. These guys are crazy. Thank God Dante isn’t following in the family business. I like him too much to want to think of him on the bottom of the Lake like his old man.,"Geez, I’m sorry. You didn’t know?",No. I just met them.,Yeah. It happened a few years ago. His boat disappeared in one of those Arctic fogs that roll down from the North Pole. A real tragedy.

You find that angel yet?",Sorry. I’m working on it.,Prob’ly in one a them fancy houses down in Newport or Hyannisport. I figgah when the nuns got too old to notice what was goin on some enterprisin youngstahs helped themselves to it and then sold it for a bundle to some big shot collectah on the sly. Them poor old dames nevah even noticed.,That’s certainly possible. Was it worth anything though? Most religious statuary isn’t particularly valuable. I’d be surprised if anyone would pay much for it.,This’n was pretty valuable from what I heard. Some priest fellah come up here from Boston one time to take pictures of it and he told me if folks round here knew what a treasure it was they’d be standin in line to see it. He said there was anothah one like it over there in Italy and it was real valuable.,Really? Do you remember anything more that he said?,"I’ll have ta study on it a bit but I remembah he said they was three a them statues—y’know like in the Bible? Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. He said that he’d seen the Michael one ovah there in Florence, Italy and now he seen the Gabriel one here but he didn’t think he’d evah get to see the Raphael one cause of it bein in a private collection nobody was sure where.",That’s interesting. I always assumed it was a standard molded statue. Do you remember the priest’s name?,"Hmmmm, that was proba’ly fifteen, twenty years ago, y’know, but he was a nice young fellah. I remembah he said he worked at that Boston College down there. I remembah that cause Cal Hurley’s one boy goes to school down there and I asked if he knew ‘im. He didn’t.",Boston College.,"Yep. He was an Irish fellah. I remembah that cause he had one a them real Irish-lookin faces with the big bushy blond eyebrows and eyes what disappear back in his head like. He said he was workin on a doctorate in art history. I remembah that much. He was a nice fellah. Took a lot of pictures. He come in here to buy more film. I couldn’t figgah out why anybody’d want to take that many pictures of something that don’t move but he seemed all excited. That’s about it, though. I remembah I felt real bad cause it wasn’t more’n a year after that when the thing gone missin and I thought that fellah would be real disappointed to know that.","I’m sure he was. Thank you, Mr. Darling, I’ll see if I can find him.",You got that internet stuff out there to the ­abbey?,"Yes, I do.",Figuahed.

Down there on the left.,Thank you.,Miss?,Yeah?,What does Father Black look like?,"Wicked hot. You know, for an older guy.",Tall and dark?,Extremely.

His statue of St. Michael is a masterpiece.,"Please, sit down. Most people never knew that he sculpted all three of the archangels. I came across references in letters he wrote when I was studying in Italy. I tracked the Raphael to a private collection in Greece. Maybe someday the world will get to see that one but, in my opinion, the Gabriel was his masterwork. Now we just have to find it."
98416__romance-crime-good-food-the-kathleen-valentine-sampler,"What I’m curious about, is how a Dupré wound up at an obscure convent in Maine.","Ah, that interested me too. I’ve done some research."

Till he became a felon anyways.",How does a fisherman become a felon?,By hunting endangered kraken and killing the coast guard.,How do you hunt a kraken?

At least I hope you did.,Like I had much choice.,"It’s just supposed t’be a bunch of militia down there, right?","According to this we need to get into a research facility being attacked by local militia. Something inside is ticking them off. They probably won’t take kindly to our being there, so we’ll have to fight through them.
